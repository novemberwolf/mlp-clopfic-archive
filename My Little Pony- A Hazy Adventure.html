<p>The rain was coming down hard in Ponyville.</p><p>Near the outskirts of the town a pink-haired pony was resting under a large tree. Several of them <br/>came together here, surrounded on all sides by a high, overgrown mass of bushes to form a <br/>little clearing. She smiled, enjoying the sound of the rain pattering over the fresh summer leaves.</p><p>Another sound pricked her ear. Somepony else was in the clearing, had just stepped next to her. <br/>She gave a little start, looking toward the sound. A unicorn smiled back at her, a muted, dusty<br/>brown color, with mane the same shade.</p><p>&quot;Sorry, did I startle you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh no, I mean yes, I mean it's fine...&quot;</p><p>The unicorn extended a hoof, smiling again. &quot;My name is Haze.&quot;</p><p>The yellow pony paused a moment, then smiled back slightly, reaching out to complete <br/>the hoof-shake. &quot;I'm fl-...fluttershy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Good to meet you Fluttershy.&quot; He sat next to her, a few feet away, and turned to look out <br/>toward the town. &quot;Caught in the rain?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes...&quot; And after an awkward pause. &quot;I don't mind though. The rain sounds nice on the leaves.&quot; <br/>She winced, afraid this sounded stupid, but the brown pony nodded. &quot;It does. A very relaxing, <br/>steady rhythm, one drop after the next, in slow,</p><p>steady</p><p>re-pe-ti-tion.&quot;</p><br/><p>Fluttershy blinked. Something had distracted her, but she couldn't remember what. Haze was <br/>in front of her, looking into her eyes.</p><p>&quot;Could you help me with something, Fluttershy?&quot; &quot;Well, um, I, really-&quot; His eyes blinked. A <br/>gentle relaxation crept through her.</p><p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wonderful. Would you mind taking a look at this?&quot; He levitated a book into her hooves, old, <br/>leather-bound and worn. &quot;Right here-&quot; his dull gray magic quickly flipped to a page a quarter <br/>of the way through.</p><p>The left-hand page was blank, but on the right-&quot;What do you see Fluttershy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-it's a maze...&quot;</p><p>Harsh, geometric angles traced back and forth across the page, forming passages that twisted <br/>in all directions, bending round and back with dizzying intricacy.</p><p>&quot;Where does it end?&quot;</p><p>Fluttershy's eyes scanned the maze. The lines seemed to converge to toward the center, but <br/>there was no clear end. Every time they got close they would break off again, another circuit, <br/>another obscure pathway. She realized she was following them, following the lines as they-</p><p>&quot;Twist and turn over the page, overlapping, underlapping, back on themselves and back to the <br/>center and around again for another pass. Keep following those lines, the center is getting close,<br/>you can feel it, you know it, you know-&quot;</p><p>The center was getting close, she could find it, she would find it.</p><p>The lines made concentrating harder and easier at the same time, deeper and deeper into the lines, <br/>the rain around her was dimming now, everything in her periphery dimming now as the lines <br/>danced and swayed so excited so focused so close now, so close to the center nearly there, <br/>there was the center there was-</p><p>The world was white.</p><p>The world was-</p><p>The world-</p><p>-</p><br/><p>Haze plucked the book from the unmoving pegasus. Her hooves stayed in place, glazed <br/>eyes still staring motionless at where the book had been.</p><p>&quot;Put your hooves down.&quot;</p><p>The yellow pegasus obeyed robotically, still staring at empty space. Haze glanced down at the book <br/>and smiled, not so friendly now. In the center of the maze, inside a small circle, three butterflies had <br/>been inked into the page. Haze looked up at the pegasus and considered what to do with his first catch.</p><p>Haze stepped in front of the unblinking pegasus, savoring the moment. It was always<br/>so much fun to see them like this. Frozen, helpless, empty. Waiting. The unicorn knew<br/>what the result would be, but he couldn't resist waving a hoof in front of the yellow<br/>pony's eyes. No response. He held his hoof to her mouth, felt the slow, shallow breaths<br/>against it. Gently pressed her jaw open, let his hoof play over her limp tongue. She was<br/>an excellent start.</p><p>Reaching into the binding of the book with his magic, Haze pulled out a battered quill,<br/>tip somehow already wet with deep black ink. Magic sparkling, he brought the book in<br/>front of him, still opened to the same place, maze on the right, blank page on the left.<br/>He let it hover there a moment, looking to the frozen pink pegasus, then out into space,<br/>then back. Then with a small smile of decision, he brought the quill to the empty page<br/>and wrote.</p><br/><p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">Sex is a normal way to help an injured pony feel better. </span><br/><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">There is nothing unusual about using sex to help an injured pony. </span></p><p>Leaning down toward the page the unicorn blew across the page, drying the ink into the<br/>ancient paper, then looked back up to his glass-eyed pegasus. Slowly, almost unnoticeably<br/>at first, Fluttershy's lips began to move. In a moment the motion was obvious, her mouth<br/>and tongue silently forming the shapes of words. The same words Haze had just written.<br/>Repeating them, again and again, a little slower each time. Until at last her lips went<br/>still again, and the pegasus gave a long, deep sigh. The words sparkled slightly<br/>on the page, then faded to dry black.</p><p>Haze closed the book, slipping it into a small bag and pulling out a small wooden case.<br/>His magic shimmered across the wood, opening it and withdrawing a thin razor. He brought<br/>the blade up a few inches above his right hoof, then cut across-</p><p>Once</p><p>Twice</p><p>Thrice</p><p>-horizontally at various angles and lengths, always shallow, careful to miss any major<br/>veins. A few more cuts and the blade was quickly cleaned and put away. Haze reached up<br/>with his hoof, holding it in the air just above Fluttershy's head and wincing at how<br/>sore it was now, then gently pulled back and down, as if he was pulling a sheet off<br/>her head.</p><p>The pegasus twitched, blinked. Looked up at him confused, then immediately apologetic.<br/>&quot;Oh. Did I fall asleep? I'm sorry...sometimes I-&quot; She caught sight of the blood<br/>dripping down Haze's hoof. &quot;You're hurt!&quot;</p><p>The unicorn grimaced. &quot;Yeah, I must have scraped myself on som-YEEE!&quot; Before Haze could<br/>finish the sentence, Fluttershy had somehow found gauze, bandages and alcohol and was<br/>already applying the latter to the wound.</p><p>&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; She apologized in worried town, seeing Haze's reaction. &quot;No problem.&quot;<br/>The unicorn replied through clenched teeth. The pegasus might have used a bit more<br/>then was strictly necissary, as Haze noted the bottle was now a quarter empty.</p><p>&quot;There you go.&quot; She said, stepping back. &quot;How does that feel?&quot;</p><p>Haze looked down at the injury, already perfectly bandaged. &quot;Pretty good actually.<br/>Still a little sore, but that serves me right for being careless.&quot; The pegasus gave<br/>a gentle smile. &quot;I'm just glad I could help. I'd hate for those cuts to go untreated.<br/>They looked pretty bad.&quot; She glanced around. &quot;How did you get them anyway? I mean if<br/>that's ok. I don't mean to pry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Like I said, careless. Say Fluttershy?&quot; The pegasus looked back toward him. &quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The bandage is really helping, but I'm still pretty sore. Is there anything else you<br/>could do to help?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, well, I have some soothing tea, but that's back at the-&quot; &quot;No no. I mean, uh-&quot;<br/>He pulled back one of his hind legs to reveal his length, already half out and hanging<br/>heavy between his legs.</p><p>&quot;OH.&quot; The pegasus instantly went a bright red. Haze shuffled his leg back. &quot;Sorry,<br/>I know some ponies aren't really comfortable, I didn't realize. I just thought-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No-&quot;</p><p>Haze mentally grinned as the yellow pegasus walked over to him. &quot;No it's...fine.&quot;<br/>He could almost see the shift as the need to nurture and help pushed aside the vague,<br/>instinctual objections her mind was making. &quot;I-it's a... perfectly normal way to help<br/>with an injury like this.&quot; The words came out slightly mechanical. &quot;And those cuts did<br/>look bad.&quot; She looked up at him. &quot;um, would you mind lying back?&quot; He did smile this<br/>time, though not as widely as he wanted to. &quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p>Haze sat back against the tree, legs spread, length in plain sight again, lying<br/>against his belly. Very gingerly, the pegasus lay in front of him, her eyes locked on<br/>the thick black shaft as her head came close. Her hooves grasped the base, pulling it<br/>up into the air, and looked up at him, giving a small noise of emberassment as his eyes<br/>met hers, then immediately shutting them. Haze watched in fascination as her tongue came<br/>closer and closer until he felt its warmth against his base, felt it slide up and<br/>swirl and gently, tenderly roll over his eager length.</p><p>The pegasus was incredible with her tongue, and when her mouth finally followed,<br/>slipping over his tip, bobbing and rolling across his length, enveloping him in warm, soft<br/>pleasure, Haze couldn't stop himself from giving a very pleased moan. She was so tender,<br/>so careful and loving with each stroke, all the right places getting exactly what they<br/>needed. Soon she began to move quicker, bob a little deeper, grasp the base gently with<br/>her hooves, press and release, press and release. The unicorn could feel every muscle in<br/>his body going limp in pure, blissful contentment. Another smile crept over his face as<br/>the sloppy wet sound of slick flesh sliding over slick flesh rose from between his legs.<br/>If only the pegasus knew what she was doing. But there would be time for that later.</p><p>He could feel himself tensing now, close. His hoof reached down, stroking Fluttershy's<br/>mane. And then, as the last crest of pleasure hit, he pulled her back. The pegasus's mouth<br/>opened to form a question, but in an instant it was full of hot, salty answer. As was her<br/>cheek, and the front of her mane, and the other side of her face, and somehow one of her ears.</p><p>The gentle yellow pegasus looked up at Haze, staring through the white liquid slowly<br/>running down her face, sticking here and there. She was paralyzed again, but this time<br/>for a very different reason. Her cheeks had gone red again.</p><p>&quot;Fluttershy? You ok?&quot; Haze waved a hoof in front of her. The pegasus blinked, shivered.<br/>Looked up at him again. &quot;Swallow.&quot; She did. &quot;You ok?&quot; After a pause, she nodded slightly,<br/>then more firmly. &quot;Sorry, I was trying to stop you before it was too late, but I guess<br/>I didn't time it quite right.&quot; The unicorn lied.</p><p>&quot;That's ok. I um...don't mind.&quot; This last part was strangely quiet. &quot;Are you feeling better?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Much better.&quot; Haze said, truthfully this time. &quot;Thank you for that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, it was nothing.&quot; the pegasus glanced shyly at the ground. &quot;Say Fluttershy?&quot;<br/>She looked up. &quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p>Haze's hoof thrust forward suddenly, out toward Fluttershy's head, then up slightly.<br/>The Pegusus's eyes glazed, body freezing in place. In the bag behind the tree, the book<br/>glowed slightly.</p><p>&quot;Did you enjoy that Fluttershy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes...&quot; The voice came back a distant, relaxed monotone.</p><br/><p>&quot;And how do you feel now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Embarassed... But good...&quot;</p><p>He smiled. &quot;Good girl. Such a dirty pony. But being a dirty pony is good. Repeat and remember.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Being a dirty pony is good.&quot; The pegasus murmured.</p><p>&quot;Good.&quot; He extended his hoof again, pulling back this time. Fluttershy blinked,<br/>back again. The rain had stopped.</p><p>&quot;I should...um...be getting back for now. If you're ok that is?&quot; She looked to Haze<br/>with concern. &quot;I'm fine, really. Thanks to you.&quot; The pegasus smiled slightly, looking<br/>back down at the ground. &quot;It was nothing. A-anyway, g-goodbye then...&quot; And she<br/>disappeared into the bushes.</p><p>Haze watched her go, then noticed that his book had fallen out of its bag. It lay<br/>on the ground, open to a page nearer the beginning. The page on the left was full<br/>of dense writing, but toward the bottom quarter it suddenly became frantic, ink<br/>splattered her and there, letters barely finished. The last few sentences were incomplete.<br/>On the right, there was only a solid mass of black.</p><p>Haze looked down grimly, and closed the book.</p>

<p>*************<br/>Supplemental<br/>*************</p><br/><p><i>Manehatten Police Report</i><br/><i>2nd Year of Harmony - [Date obscured]</i></p><p><i>At 10 pm last night the fire department responded to numerous reports</i><br/><i>of flames and smoke issuing from a small office on the 23rd floor of</i><br/><i>the Cranehurst building. Once the flames were extinguished the cause</i><br/><i>was discovered to be a faulty electric light that had fallen from the</i><br/><i>ceiling onto several open (and apparently partially full) bottles of</i><br/><i>alcohol.</i></p><p><i>Initial attempts to locate the office tenant, a &quot;Stormy Night,&quot; were</i><br/><i>unsuccessful, and interviews with other tenants and the building manager</i><br/><i>revealed that he had not been seen in over a week. At this point the</i><br/><i>investigation shifted from arson to missing persons, and my department</i><br/><i>was brought in.</i></p><p><i>This file is a complete catalog of the evidence and documents</i><br/><i>gathered from the scene, a surprising number of which survived both</i><br/><i>the fire and water. The story they tell is notable: clearly Mr. Night</i><br/><i>had an obsession which was causing him a number of concerns. Whether</i><br/><i>it had any significant connection to his disappearance is unclear.</i><br/><i>As of yet we have not discovered any significant leads as to the</i><br/><i>nature of his disappearance or his current status.</i><br/></p><p>-----------</p><br/><br/><p>Item #4</p><p>Old manuscript. Handwritten, badly burnt and illegible in places.</p><br/><p>&quot;-generally do this in two ways. The first is eye contact, which can<br/>be used to induce an unnatural relaxation or sense of ease.</p><p>The second is a steady rhythm, often a tapping or a carefully spoken<br/>word. This seems to serve as a stronger version of the first method, inducing<br/>intense relaxation and mild euphoria in the victim. This method's main<br/>weakness is that it is in some sense too effective. While very pliable, <br/>victims are so relaxed that they seem to be unable to understand anything beyond<br/>very simple commands, and any complicated or long-term manipulation is <br/>impossible. Efficacy varies widely depending on the victim, [several words smeared]<br/>and various other factors, and intensity can be increased if the user is patient, but both<br/>methods seem to rapidly decrease in strength if used repeatedly in a short period of time.</p><p>Both abilities are fairly weak, but this also makes them easy to<br/>perform (and repeat if needed) and hard to detect. In isolation, they<br/>are mildly hazardous, parlor tricks that are just a little too good.<br/>Mixed with other talents, they are the beginning of a very dark night.&quot;</p>

<br/><p>The morning rain was still drying off the leaves of the apple trees. Under one of the largest <br/>a golden yellow pony was already back at work, mud splattered up her hooves. She gave <br/>the trunk a hard kick. The branches shuddered, and several apples fell neatly into the <br/>bushel below, already nearly full. </p><p>Applejack stopped a minute, taking a deep breath in. The smell of the orchard after a <br/>rain was really something. Fresh and eager, full of life. She was sure the crop this year <br/>would be one of the best ever.</p><p>A wet splash came suddenly from behind her, and the farm pony whirled around to see <br/>a dusty brown unicorn emerging from behind one of the trees. He gave an apologetic smile. <br/>&quot;Sorry, I didn't mean to surprise you. Are you Applejack?&quot;</p><p>She gave an easy smile, leaning back against the tree. &quot;That's me. And who might you be?<br/>Don’t remember seein’ you ‘round Ponyville before.&quot; Something about the unicorn made her <br/>slightly uneasy, but she couldn't put her hoof on it. No use in jumping to conclusions again <br/>though, Twilight kept telling her that. Mind over gut. Anyway, no need to be rude. Unicorns <br/>were always a little strange, it was probably just on account of that.</p><p>The unicorn returned her smile. &quot;Glad I finally found you. My name is Haze-&quot; He took a small <br/>bag from his back. &quot;Twilight said you might know something about this-&quot; And pulled a worn leather <br/>book from it. </p><p>Applejack gave the book a puzzled look as the unicorn held it out. &quot;Ah'd be glad to help, <br/>any friend a Twilight's a friend a mine and all, but Ah'm not sure there's much Ah can do. <br/>Books are really more her thing, livin’ in a library and all-&quot; She glanced over the volume<br/>as Haze turned it for her. The leather was heavily scraped and bruised, and in a few places <br/>it had what looked like claw marks cut into it. The only label was a title written in faded black <br/>ink across the front. Applejack didn't recognize the language. </p><p>&quot;Ah'm sorry sugar, none of this is really ringin’ any bells. You sure she said Ah was the one to ask?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was surprised too, but she insisted.&quot; The unicorn replied, opening the book to a page near <br/>the middle. &quot;Right here, take a look. Can you see the apples there?&quot;</p><p>The page on the left was blank, so the farm pony's eyes went to the right. There were no<br/>apples on the paper there though, only a whirlpool of lines twisting around the center, passageways<br/>threading back and forth.</p><p>&quot;You sure this is the right page sugarcube? All that's here is a mess of lines-&quot; She blinked. <br/>Had the world just BENT, in and out a bit? Had she been out bucking longer than she <br/>thought? She did forget a break or two once in a while, and forgetting several in a row<br/>did have an…interesting effect on her sight sometimes. But that couldn’t be, she <br/>had only started a few hours ago, so what in the hay-and were the lines MOVING on <br/>the page now? Applejack started to back away from the book. &quot;Ah really think you should <br/>take this back to Twilight-&quot; Nevermind the unicorn, something was definitely not right<br/>with this book. As she backed away Haze followed her, keeping the book close. She <br/>realized she couldn't get her eyes to leave the page. The lines were spinning now. </p><p>&quot;Please, ya really need ta’ put that away now-&quot; &quot;But it's right there Applejack. Just look<br/>a little closer.&quot;</p><p>The farm pony's head stopped with a thud and she realized she had backed up on to the tree.<br/>She was up on her back legs now, and when she tried to slide away to the right she found<br/>she couldn’t. The same for the left. Her hooves scraped frantically at the tree, trying to find<br/>some grip to help her pull away, her mind not processing what was wrong. Panic ran over<br/>her like ice, stetson falling from her head as she jerked helplessly against the trunk.</p><p>&quot;Please, close it! Close it! For the love of Celestia, close the book!&quot; Her eyes were starting to<br/>tear up, neat ponytail fraying against the bark.</p><p>The unicorn stood his ground, those horrible pages still hovering in front of her eyes, swirling<br/>and twisting and pulling at her. &quot;But you're so close AJ. So close-&quot; She could feel it pressing <br/>against her mind as the lines swirled on the page, pressing in like a hoof against her mouth, <br/>cutting off the air, the life. She could feel her mind struggling and losing, slowly going dim, <br/>going limp. </p><p>&quot;What’re you…doin’….&quot; The words were barely audible, a choking gasp. The world was a <br/>confused mess of whirling colors now, all of it slowly fading. From somewhere far away she <br/>heard the unicorn's voice.</p><p>&quot;Sshhh. It's time to rest now.&quot;</p><p>She felt her body give a shudder, and everything sank into inky black.</p><br/><p>************</p><p>Haze watched in satisfaction as the earth pony slumped at the base of the tree, front legs <br/>sprawling limply. Her head had tilted back, and glazed eyes now stared blankly at the<br/>open sky. He reached out with a hoof, stroking the straw-colored hair, gently pressing her <br/>mouth closed then watching as it slowly slipped open again, drool running from one of the corners. <br/>Never got old.</p><p>He had been concerned with the earlier catch; Everything about her had seemed fragile, as if <br/>she might shatter like a glass figurine if he closed his grip too tightly. He didn't want that, <br/>not this soon anyway. The breaking was fun, but after it was over there was nothing left <br/>to enjoy. So he had been gentle.</p><p>This one though, she radiated strength. Her whole body was toned with muscle and <br/>endurance from her daily work, and he could sense her mind was even stronger. <br/>She wasn’t fragile glass. She could handle some real fun. Turning over the book, he <br/>confirmed that the farm pony’s three apples were tightly interwoven with the lines <br/>of the maze, then turned to the blank page and began to write.</p><p>*****</p><p>Applejack stopped, head tilting as she tried to re-orient herself. Her train of thought <br/>felt like it had wandered off the rails and sunk into a swamp. She shook her head,<br/>trying to clear the fog, then turned back to the tree she had been working on. </p><p>The three baskets she had brought to collect her apples caught her eye. Full already.<br/>How in the-how had she managed that without noticing? Maybe she really did need<br/>more than four hours of sleep like Twilight kept saying. Then again, the apples had <br/>still been bucked, one way or th’ other. </p><p>As she pondered this, loading up the first bushel onto a nearby cart, a voice called out <br/>behind her.</p><p>&quot;Hello there!&quot; A brown unicorn the farm pony didn't recognize waved to her. <br/>&quot;You know where I can find Applejack?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Speakin' and present!&quot; She smiled, tilting her hat slightly. &quot;Now why would you be<br/>lookin' for me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, as it turns out I've heard you may be able to help me with something <br/>important.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Always glad ta help where Ah can. What didya-&quot; The unicorn plucked an apple from <br/>the basket, took a small bite from one side, a similar one from the other, then set <br/>the apple on a nearby barrel with a firm thud. </p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Applejacks eyes were fixed on the apple, the cheery smile melted from<br/>her face by fear. All of the friendly had just drained from the unicorn.</p><p>&quot;Where's the money Applejack?&quot; The words were calm, but sharp like a razor.</p><p>She took a step back. &quot;It's comin', honest, Ah just-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where's the money Applejack?&quot; The unicorn stepped forward and Applejack retreated, <br/>back toward the tree. &quot;Ah'm almost there, really, I just need time ta-&quot;</p><p>&quot;You needed time three months ago Applejack. And three months before that.&quot; The <br/>farm pony realized she was up against the cart now, as the unicorn pressed in on her. <br/>He held up his hooves, as if showing a child they were empty. &quot;There’s no more time.<br/>It’s all gone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah can pay, really!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then you should have, before I showed up.&quot; The unicorn growled, inches from her face. <br/>&quot;Now there are new rules. Let me lay them out.&quot; He plucked the hat off her head and <br/>took a step back.</p><p>&quot;You're going to work your debt off. How we say, when we say.” He turned the hat in his<br/>hooves slowly, examining it. “And if we have trouble with you, bad things will happen. <br/>To the orchard-&quot; He crumpled the hat- &quot;To the farm-&quot; a burst of magic flickered at the base<br/>of the stetson, and suddenly flames engulfed it. &quot;And to your family.&quot;</p><p>Rage flickered in the farm pony's eyes at this last mention. &quot;You leave them out of this.”</p><p>“I didn’t bring them into it, you did.”</p><p>Eyes still afire, she lowered her head, like a bull considering a charge. “You sure tanglin’ <br/>with me is a good idea sugar?”  The unicorn stayed where he was. “I’m not here to <br/>tangle. I’m here to collect. Either from you now, or from what you care about later. <br/>Your choice.” He dropped the flaming mass that had been her hat, stamping it out<br/>with his foot. “There’s not a third option. Because you won’t take it. Because if you asked<br/>your friends for help, you’d have to tell them why you need it. Why you took out that<br/>loan. And if you could do that, you would have, six months ago.”</p><p>&quot;And you know their help wouldn’t matter in the end, even if you could get it. No pony can <br/>be everywhere, all the time. One way or another, Mr. Core always collects on his debts. Pay<br/>what you owe, or watch as we take it.&quot;</p><p>He lowered his face to her angry glare, utterly cold as he looked into her eyes. <br/>“Which is it going to be?”</p><p>The farm pony tensed, every muscle ready to tear the unicorn apart for what he was saying.<br/>Tense. Ready. And then it collapsed. A moment later she was standing limply against the cart, <br/>staring blankly at the dirt. <br/>He was right.</p><p>&quot;What kinda work?&quot;</p><br/><br/><br/><p>*****</p><p>Applejack sat on the dusty floor of the supply shed. In the dim light filtering through <br/>the gaps in the crude siding, she could see the unicorn standing over her, leaning <br/>back against the wall. She could see his length, hanging inches from her nose. She <br/>could smell him. She glared up at him in disgust and he glared back with something <br/>terrifying in his eyes, with the look a lion gives a rodent trapped in its paws. Hungry <br/>contempt. She felt something in her go cold and afraid, and the growl slipped off her <br/>face, her gaze falling to the floor.</p><p>He grabbed her hair and jerked her forward, mashing her nose against his balls. <br/>Told her to lick. She did. She could taste his sweat, his skin, every detail. Thank Celestia,<br/>it wasn't as awful as she had feared. She could keep going, barely. She could make<br/>this bastard happy. She had to, or he would take it all. Burn it all. She couldn't let <br/>that happen, had to keep going, keep licking, keep rolling over the skin, lapping here <br/>and there, sucking and licking and rolling her tongue over the horrible unicorn's <br/>warm, heavy sack...</p><p>He pressed her muzzle up, told her to start on the shaft. She felt a brief spark of anger<br/>but it quickly sank into the quagmire of hopelessness that was filling her mind.<br/>She started at his base and worked up, doing her honest best, eyes closed in <br/>Concentration, trying not to think about what she was doing as she twisted and lapped <br/>along the flesh, clumsy but earnest. She could feel him stiffen under her attention <br/>until he was hard and hot under every stroke of her tongue. </p><p>When he told her to take it in her mouth there was something dangerous in his voice,<br/>and she had barely begun to try sliding down his length when he grabbed her hair and <br/>yanked back, throwing her into the dirt. Pathetic. What a worthless pony. If she <br/>farmed like she sucked cock he could see why she needed the money so bad. Well he <br/>wasn't one for farming, but he could sure teach her one thing-</p><p>The hoof grabbed her hair again, pulling her forward, forcing her to hobble awkwardly <br/>and painfully where he pulled her. He brought her back to his length, the tip pressed <br/>to her lips, pressed in. And then he pulled forward, hard, forcing her down deep.</p><p>Applejack panicked, gagged, hoofs instinctively going to the unicorn's waist to pull back. </p><p><i>Sure you want to do that?</i></p><p>He gave her a look that could cut iron. The tone of his voice matched. Still choking, <br/>she slowly lowered her hooves, letting them hang uselessly at her sides.</p><p><i>Good girl.</i></p><p>He pulled back slightly, gave her a brief moment to recover, then pressed back in. The<br/>farm pony did her best to give the unicorn what he wanted, but her body still twitched<br/>and tried to strain back involuntarily as the thick flesh hit the back of her throat. He didn't <br/>let it. His hooves held her head firmly in place, both of them now, as he pressed into her. <br/>She gagged, choked, shuddered as he coldly pressed into her, tears filling her eyes as her <br/>mind reeled.</p><p>...</p><p>She was gagging less now. He had taught her, taking his time, giving brief gasps of air<br/>when she did well, twisting her ear and getting rougher when she did not, until her<br/>nose finally pressed against his belly. All the way down. She could feel his tip twitching<br/>deep inside her. </p><p>She looked up at him. He smiled down at her, stroked her hair. Good girl. She gave a <br/>muffled moan, smiling pathetically, stupidly around the flesh filling her mouth. Smiling like<br/>something was broken. Everything was limp now, body and spirit. She would do what she <br/>was told. She would be a good girl.</p><p><i>Now suck it the right way.</i></p><p>She felt the command in his eyes more than she heard it. She let it burn through her. <br/>Closed her eyes. Slipped back, just far enough to take a gasp of precious air. Then<br/>came down again, all the way down, hilting him in her throat. Just obey. Don't fight.<br/>Don't think. Just obey. Carefully, she started to bob and twist her head, working along<br/>his length as he had taught her to, her tear-stained face a picture of pure exhausted <br/>surrender.</p><p>...</p><p>Applejack sat on the dusty floor of the supply shed. In the dull, late afternoon light<br/>filtering through the boards she could see Haze's cock in front of her, held in her<br/>hooves, tip resting against her outstretched tongue. She had pleased him. She could <br/>feel the warmth of his pleasure running down her cheek, her neck. The reek of sex <br/>filled the shed, filled her nose, filled her mind. She ran her hooves tenderly back and<br/>forth over his length, trying to please him again. </p><p>This was her work now. She would please stallions. He had taught her, over and over. <br/>She had learned. She was a good pony. She would please stallions and everyone would <br/>Be safe. If she was stupid and bad it would all go away. But that wouldn't happen.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>&quot;Ghuughd Puuonee&quot; She slurred against the hot flesh resting on her tongue. He gave a<br/>pleased nod, then tensed, pressing forward a little into her stroking.Hot, filthy pleasure burst <br/>over her tongue, into her mouth, against the back of her throat.  Burst after burst. She froze, <br/>every thought focused on the cock in her hooves, on catching every last drop. </p><p>As Haze finally finished and pulled back, Applejack's hooves sank to the ground. <br/>She gazed blankly ahead a moment, then gave a breathy, faltering sigh. Relief. <br/>Satisfaction. The corners of her limp, open mouth twitched into a dumb smile. She looked<br/>up to Haze, as if to say something. Then a brief look of confusion flickered over her face.</p><p>The next moment the pupils in the farm pony's eyes rolled up, her eyelids fluttered shut, <br/>and with a gentle groan her body toppled over, coming to rest against the side of the <br/>shed. A clump of unswallowed &quot;pleasure&quot; slowly traced down her tongue as it hung limply<br/>from her open mouth, hovered a moment at the tip, then fell to the dusty floor. </p><p>The unicorn gave a satisfied grin. Reaching into his bag, he pulled out something that sparkled<br/>in the dim light, flipped it toward the collapsed farm pony and left the shed, closing the<br/>door behind him.</p><p>The five-bit piece clanked along the floor, spinning for a moment in front of Applejack, then <br/>toppled over, sinking into the white pool forming beneath her mouth.</p>

					</header>


<p>The failing light of the evening cast golden highlights over the ornate edges of Ponyville's famous boutique. Through the windows a few prime outfits could be glimpsed; skillful, creative, full of color. The sign on the door announced the business closed for the day, a full two hours ago.</p><p>But from the back room of the shop a mad frenzy of sound was still flowing; the snipping of scissors, the drawing of fabric against fabric, rulers coming and going, pencils scribbling. The boutique's owner was almost a blur, purple mane twisting back and forth as she zipped back and forth between the islands of creation scattered across the floor; a sewing machine surrounded in fabric here, a pattern-covered table there, half a dozen manikins with sections of fabric pinned here and there. And in the center, hung on the main figure, a masterpiece was taking shape. </p><p>Deep black fabric the color of night curved and twisted over the frame, each cut and seam masterful and exact. The form resembled an evening gown, but its simple shape was punctuated here and there with intricate details; little folds, subtle hems, a hundred small additions that blended in from a distance and slowly revealed themselves on closer inspection.</p><p>A few more snips, a few more frantic flashes of the needle, and the unicorn collapsed in front of her creation, exhausted, but proud. It was finally finished. A full month of research, planning, throwing patterns out and starting over, and so many, many hours in this room, sewing and cutting and testing and now it was ready. It was no trivial thing to make a formal gown fitting for the princess, but she had done it, at last.  And now, at last, she could rest.</p><p>A knock came at the door. </p><p>The unicorn groaned, not moving. &quot;WE'RE CLOSED!&quot; She yelled in an uncharacteristically brutish tone from her comfortable place on the floor. &quot;COME BACK TOMORROW!&quot; Tomorrow was a holiday, she remembered, but the unicorn was too tired to correct herself.</p><p>The knocking continued.</p><p>Groaning again, the unicorn pulled herself to her feet, promising her body it would only be for a few minutes, and headed for the door. She would just have to tell this ruffian to leave face to face. Who did he think he was, knocking at this hour? What rational pony would expect a clothing shop to be open hours after the sun had set? And after all she could understand not being able to wait to browse clothing so skillfully crafted and so stylish, but really. Ponyville was a friendly enough place, but sometimes it...it...<br/>She blinked. Her train of thought had gone missing. Well, small wonder considering the hour. No civilized pony should even be awake right now, let alone expected to have coherent thoughts or answer doors or...</p><p>What had she been thinking again? The unicorn gave a grunt of frustration as the knocking continued and kept heading for the door. She was getting rid of this pony and then heading straight for bed. She clearly needed sleep. To recharge and relax and slip away...</p><p>She hadn't noticed before, but the knocking had a kind of rhythm to it. Hard to pin down, but definitely there. Steady and strangely attractive, relaxing, like everything could just go limp...</p><p>and smooth...</p><p>and muffled...</p><p>and blank...</p><p>She opened the door. A dusty brown unicorn smiled back at her.</p><p>&quot;We're closed.&quot; The purple-haired unicorn mouthed robotically, not really remembering why she was saying the words anymore.</p><p>&quot;No you're not.&quot; The brown unicorn said gently. &quot;You were just about to open, just for me. Remember Rarity?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I was just about to open. Yes...&quot; Rarity said blankly, eyes unfocused. Everything was vague, hazy. She couldn't really see anything besides the brown unicorn in front of her. He took out a book, opened it, held it up to her. Pointed to the page. </p><p>&quot;Look here.&quot;</p><p>She looked. Lines swirled and turned, a maze of paths every-twisting to the center, always to the center but never quite reaching it. Something deep in her mind objected, but it was swept away in the gentle, limp calm, nothing to hold on to, no way to resist. For just an instant she felt something reaching out from the book, reaching into her mind. And then black.</p><hr/><p>Rarity paced nervously in the front of her boutique. Why wasn't the client here already? Why did he have to schedule such a late appointment? Not that she was complaining, it was an honor to have someone so high-profile and someone with such deep pockets, and someone who could actually appreciate the depth of fashion on display, but still-</p><p>A knock came on the door.</p><p>She was a blur of white, vanishing and reappearing at the door, hurling it open with quite unladylike force. A brown unicorn in an expensive suit smiled back at her. He was here!</p><p>&quot;O-oh hello sir, I'm so glad you could finally make it to carousel boutique. Please come in!&quot;</p><p>He stepped inside, Rarity quickly closing the door behind him. &quot;It's a pleasure to be here. I've heard so much about your work-&quot; He stepped past a few of the outfits at the front of the store, looking them over. &quot;And I've wanted to take a closer look for so long.&quot;<br/>Rarity suppressed a burst of excitement at the compliment, trying her best to remain professional. &quot;Oh I assure you, it's a pleasure to offer my services to such a cultured pony.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I hope the late appointment wasn't too much trouble, it's hard for me to get away sometimes-&quot; He turned over the collar on one of the suits, inspecting it.  </p><p>&quot;Oh not at all, I completely understand. Was there anything in particular you were...&quot;</p><p>The brown unicorn had stopped in front of the black evening gown, beautifully on display in its own alcove. &quot;My, this is a lovely piece.&quot; He ran a hoof down the back, tracing the seam.</p><p>Rarity felt a twinge of nervousness at anyone touching something that had taken so long to make, but she pushed it back. &quot;Y-yeees, that's a little something the princess had commissioned. It's not for sale of course, but if you like it I'd be glad to make something similar-&quot;</p><p>The brown unicorn's hoof traced the collar of the gown. &quot;It looks very well-made. But I wonder-&quot;</p><p>Rarity's nervousness suddenly swelled. &quot;W-what are you-&quot;</p><p>And then a nightmarish sound split the air. The sound of ripping fabric.</p><p>There was a tear on the gown now, from the collar several inches down into the fabric. The seamstress’s eyes went wide as dinner plates. &quot;W-wha, wha, what did you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not very sturdy though. I'm disappointed Rarity.&quot;</p><p>The shock and horror was starting to mix with anger. &quot;H-how could you...w-what do you think you're-&quot;</p><p>Another ripping sound. Another tear from the collar, deeper this time.</p><p>&quot;WHAT ARE YOU DOING?&quot; The white unicorn’s eyes were blazing now. The brown unicorn seemed unconcerned. &quot;Showing you what shoddy work you're doing. You think this is worthy of a princess? I'm barely touching it and it's coming apart in my hooves. Look at this.&quot; Another tear.</p><p>&quot;STOP THAT! STOP!&quot; The shock was wearing off a little and Rarity was closing the distance between them, determined to stop this mad pony.</p><p>&quot;Why should I?&quot; Another tear. &quot;STOP! STop or...&quot; The white unicorn blinked. She had felt something else on that last tearing noise, something that wasn't shock or rage. Something that was warm and heavy.</p><p>The brown unicorn ignored her. &quot;This is obviously poor work Rarity. And poor work should be destroyed. Don't you agree?&quot; Another tear.</p><p>&quot;No, why are you...why...&quot; There it was again, hotter, heavier. She wanted to kick this ruffian's teeth in for vandalizing her work, smash his head into the wall, throw him out into the street face-first. But every time he tore into the dress it was hard to concentrate. Every time it was painful, agonizing to watch something she had spent so much time and effort on be so casually destroyed. But that agony felt...good somehow. REALLY good. </p><p>She tried to close the last few feet between them, but he tore into the dress again, and the heat hit her like a wave this time, stronger, harder, overwhelming. She groaned as she felt her body tremble, heat pulse between her legs. Her knees gave out, collapsing the unicorn into a sitting pose she struggled uselessly to rise from.  </p><p>&quot;Please, stop...&quot; Her voice was getting rough now, panting. The brown unicorn ignored her, picking at the gown here and there as he continued his vandalism.  </p><p>&quot;This is the way things are Rarity. Failures must be destroyed.&quot; A tear along the hem. &quot;The weak must be destroyed.&quot; A tear up the sleeve. &quot;To make way for the strong. Don't you agree?&quot;  </p><p>&quot;Y-you're insane-&quot; The words were gasped through forced pleasure, hard to speak.  </p><p>The white unicorn could feel her arousal slick between her legs, could feel a burning blush growing on her cheeks. Her whole body was trembling slightly now as she struggled to hold back the waves of heat that washed over her at every new act of destruction, but she could feel it was a losing battle. And it wasn't just the heat now. His words, his violence, the destruction was pulling her in, pressing her down. A part of her mind was screaming, moaning now that it wanted to be that dress, it wanted to be vandalized, it wanted to be destroyed. It would feel so good. It would feel so good! She was trying to hold it down, but it moaned harder with each tear, each tug at the dress.</p><p>&quot;Don't you agree?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No!&quot; Tears were starting to well in her eyes from the emotional tug of war.</p><p>&quot;Don't you agree?&quot; He pulled out a box cutter, drew out the blade, held it to the dress. The white unicorn's eyes went wider than dinner plates.</p><p>&quot;ohcelestiano-&quot;</p><p>One quick pulling swipe, right along the side of the gown. The quiet sound of cut fabric. An instant later the bottom of the gown sagged, cut loose from its top half, horrible, irreparably disfigured.</p><p>The white unicorn twitched, gave a quick, choked gasp, and then came, howling, a very uncivilized, animalistic squeal pouring from her as the hardest orgasm she had ever experienced tore through her helpless body. In one instant all resistance, all reservation, everything remotely lady-like or civilized was burned away to cinders by white-hot pleasure.</p><p>When the climax finally ended the white unicorn sat limp for a moment, shivering, eyes blank and unfocused, mouth hung open in a shameless expression of bestial lust. And then with an exhausted groan she collapsed, sprawling forward onto the floor.<br/>The brown unicorn pressed a hoof against her head, voice much less cultured now. &quot;Failures must be destroyed. Don't you agree cunt?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeessss...&quot; The white unicorn happily slurred beneath him.</p><p>&quot;And what is a pony that makes worthless, pathetic 'clothing' like this?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A fah..failure...&quot;</p><p>&quot;So what should I do with you?&quot;</p><p>The fallen unicorn's face twisted into an obscene, blissful grin. &quot;Dehs..Destroyeee mee...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would you like that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeesh...&quot;</p><p>He ground the hoof into her head. &quot;Beg for it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Phluease destroy mheee...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Louder.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please destroy me!&quot;</p><p>&quot;LOUDER&quot;</p><p>&quot;PLEASE DESTROY ME UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT!&quot;</p><p>The brown unicorn laughed. &quot;Good.&quot; Rarity coughed painfully as a kick found her stomach. &quot;Get up.&quot; <br/>As the white unicorn struggled to her feet, her tormentor roughly pulled the tattered remains of the gown from the dummy and slowly dressed her in it. When it was finally in place, he gave another laugh. “Worthless garbage wearing worthless garbage. A perfect match.” She gave a dumb, exhausted smile. He was right. She was getting turned on again just feeling the ravaged fabric against her skin. A perfect match.</p><p>He reached out with his magic, grabbing her hair and tugging toward the now-bare display dummy. “Over here…” With a tug he tossed her over the back of the dummy, her bare slick sex now helplessly on display between her dangling legs. His magic reached out again, pulling one of the seamstress’s stools over to the dummy. Stepping on to it brought him to just the right height. <br/>Rarity gasped as she felt the length of his cock press against her sex, thick and eager. He grasped her hair again, pulling her head up and holding the box cutter in front of her face. She watched wide-eyed as it opened and the blade lowered, until it rested on the fabric of the gown’s collar. He pressed against her ear, whispering. “Ready to get what you deserve you worthless cunt? “ The words ran through her like the hit of a drug. So very, very good. She trembled in anticipation beneath him, and in the end the white unicorn could only manage a guttural, needy groan.</p><p>With a quiet laugh he drew back his hips, positioning. There was a quick, deft movement and the dangerously sharp blade cut into the collar of the gown, carefully avoiding the white neck beneath. And as the newly masochist unicorn began to reel, her new master took her, deep and hard.</p><hr/><p>It was almost dawn. The first rays of the sun traced over a chaotic mess inside the show room of the carousel boutique. Usually the height of order, it was now a disaster. Reams of fabric were pulled from their shelves, scattered across the floor amongst scissors, thread and bits of patterns. Dummies were knocked over here and there and dresses and suits, torn and disfigured, were pinned across the walls like vandalized ornaments.</p><p>In the alcove where the princesses’ gown had been, the shop’s proprietor lay, propped against the wall. She was bare of any clothing; all that remained of the gown were shredded scraps sprinkled over her and the surrounding floor and a hoofful that had been forced into her mouth. Her head lolled to one side, expression blank, eyes clouded over, mouth hanging limp. Only the very slight movement of her chest gave any indication that she was still alive. Semen was scattered across her chest, ran from her mouth, pooled between her legs. Her ass was a bright red, the shape of a yard stick end still visible in the bruises. </p><p>Her tormentor had conditioned her carefully before he left. Today was a holiday, the boutique was closed. No one would find her. She would wake, she would clean up, and she would “forget” all of this had happened and go on as normal. The bruises were an unfortunate fashion accident that was better not asked about, she had fallen asleep before she could start on the gown but it could still be finished in time if she hurried. </p><p>But underneath that layer of varnish, she would always remember what she had learned, she would always be ready to remember it when asked. She would never forget exactly what she was, and what she was good for. And she would never forget how much she enjoyed being reminded, over and over again.</p>

					</header>


<p>A cheerful whistling melody rose through the doors at Sugar Cube Corner, greeting ponies as they passed. The day was in full gear, and so was the bakery. Inside a delicious mix of aromas filled the air, sugary of course, but mixed with the smell of baking; rising bread and muffins and rolls. The mix was perfect, not overpowering or cloying but gently hanging in the air, a cheerful invitation from the hundreds of delicious treats arranged on display under glass, waiting to be devoured. </p><p>The friendly melody was flowing from a bright pink pony behind the counter, happily whistling as she applied frosting to two trays of fresh, hot cupcakes, one with a frosting tube in her front hoof and one, for some reason, with another held in her back left. Every few seconds she would turn with a little jump in time with the song, reversing back and front to do opposite trays. Despite this odd strategy, the frosting was going on perfectly, swirling in neat cones until the pony cut it of with a practiced twist. The whole manuver was all the more impressive because the pink baker seemed more focused on the song than her task: the perfectly laid frosting was either muscle memory or instinct. </p><p>The bell over the door gave a friendly ring as a customer entered. “Hey there!” The pink pony called out in a voice as bouncy and friendly as her hair, waving to the unicorn stepping through the door. “Welcome to Sugar Cube Corner! Anything I can get for you? We've got cupcakes and cakes and pies and cupcakes and some strudels, no noodles though I wish we had noodles 'cause that would be fun to say, noodles and strudels noodles and strudles noodles and strudles-saaaay-” She stopped abruptly, giving the brown unicorn a suddenly suspicious look. “Are you new?”</p><p>The unicorn smiled. “Just arrived yesterday. Still learning my way around.” He extended a hoof. “Haze.”</p><p>The baker seemed to glow at this information. In an instant she was somehow suddenly over the counter and shaking the unicorn's hand VERY enthusiastically. “Pin-Kee Pie at your service! Except you don't have to say it like that, Pinkie Pie is fine or Pinkie or Pie or 'Hey you!' but that could get confusing if you said it in a crowd and everyone would turn because they thought you meant them but you didn't.” Sudden gasp of air.</p><p>“Anyway, you picked the right place to arrive!” She continued, thankfully a little slower now, releasing his hoof  to gesture at the store's stock. “And the right place in the right place! Sugar Cube Corner has the tastiest treats in the whole town! And I know this town like the back of my hoof, so if you need anything or anypony just let me know and I'll let them know that I know that you want to know. Ya know?”</p><p>The unicorn gave a smile and a nod. </p><p>Noticing that a few cupcakes were still bare, the pink pony jumped back behind the counter, grasping the frosting in her mouth as she continued.</p><p>“Shoow whha brrins yu tuuh puhnnvuh ahehay?”</p><p>Haze watched the pink pony with amusement, another smile spreading over his muzzle. “There's something I want. Something I've been looking for a very long time.” His gaze fell to Pinkie's eyes, still focused on the cupcake. Hovered there. “And I think I'll find it here.”</p><p>Pinkie set down the frosting again. “Ooo, mysterious! Anything I can do to help? I'm pretty good at mysteries you know. Twilight doesn't think so, but I just need a second chance. That hat and pipe were defective!”</p><p>The unicorn gave an appreciative nod, smiling. “I'll let you know.”</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>“For now, I think I'll just take a look around. I have a feeling there's something in this shop I'll enjoy.” His smile curled up menacingly for a moment. “While I do, why don't you tell me more about some of the ponies here? I do have a lot to catch up on.”</p><p>Pinkie glowed again. “Of course! Well should I start alphabetically or reverse alphabetically or by age although I'm not completely 100% on all of those so maybe-” As the pony talked, Haze glanced through the display case, pretending to examine an elaborate fondant-covered cake as his hoof idly rose to the glass, knocking against it in a soft rhythm. Clack clack, clickity-clack.</p><p>“The Cakes live here, they've had the place for ages I used to come here when I was young and I looooved the cupcakes and so one day Mr. Cake  said-”</p><p><i>Clack clack, clickity-clack-</i></p><p>“And I've been working here ever since. And that's how I met Noteworthy for the first time I was finishing a cake right here and he came in and he was wearing these huuuge sunglasses-”</p><p><i> Clack clack, clickity-clack-</i></p><p>“So I said 'bees are great but what about the waterslide?' and they all looked at me like I was crazy! Me!  But then-”</p><p><i> Clack clack, clickity-clack-</i></p><p>“And that was how we put out the fire at the mill! Carmel really has some hidden talents but I suppose everyone does when they really get a chance, you've just got to be at the right place at the right time or the right place a little earlier so you can wait and then it'll BE the right time, like this one time-”</p><p><i>Clickity-clickity, clickity-clack- </i></p><p>“I didn't even know cows could DO that, but Applejack said-”</p><p>“Say Pinkie?”</p><p>“Mmm?” The pony turned toward Haze's voice with a cheerful smile.</p><p>CLACK!</p><p>The unicorn's hooves came together hard, right in front of the earth pony's face. She blinked, twitched, and then-</p><p>“Ooooohohoho!” In an instant the pony's eyes glazed, and as her VERY happy voice faded away with a dazed laugh, her body gave out, melting into a limp, smiling puddle on the floor.</p><p>Calmly, Haze stepped to the front door, turning the sign hanging from the glass to “Sorry, we're closed!” and locking it. A gentle tug of his magic brought the shades on the front windows down, and once they were secure he turned, stepping back to the limp, dazed baker on the floor.</p><p>“Can you hear me Pinkie?”</p><p>“Mmmhmm.” The pony gave a nod against the floor.</p><p>“How do you feel?”</p><p>The earth pony gave an intoxicated giggle against the floorboards. “Reeealy ghoood...”</p><p>Haze grinned. “Good. Sit up.”</p><p>With a happy moan, the earth pony tried to pick herself off the floor, collapsed, and tried again. After several attempts she managed to prop herself up weakly in a precarious sitting position, eyes still  blank, mouth pulled in a big, sloppy smile.</p><p>Haze stepped up to the pink pony, circling her like a hungry predator, savoring those blank, oblivious eyes as he ran a hoof down her springy mane, circling down to tease the underside of her chin. “This is a good look for you Pinkie. Limp, open and quiet.” Pressing against her back, he stroked a hoof over her flank, another running slowly down her belly and in-between her legs. “Even so-” He whispered into her ear- “I can't wait to hear how you squeal.” </p><p>Eager to start, Haze reached out with his magic, slipping open his saddle bag and pulling out the book. Opening it to a fresh page, he brought it in front of the dazed pony's gaze, its sinister maze swirling and twisting on the page. “Watch the book Pinkie. Get a good look.” Haze grinned as he saw the pink pony's eyes focus on the page, beginning to trace the lines. This was easier than he had expected.</p><p>And then, slowly, she raised a hoof, pressing it to the book and beginning to move it, slowly at first, then faster, faster...</p><p>Haze blinked. “Pinkie, what are you doing?”</p><p>Her voice came back a happy, dazed murmur. “Solving the maze.”</p><p>“Solving...the maze?”</p><p>“Mmmhmm.”</p><p>Her hoof traced faster and faster until it was a blur moving back and forth over the paper. Haze felt a strange tingle of fear, mind beginning to race. But before the unicorn had a chance to react, Pinkie's hoof came to a dead stop at the center. </p><p>“Aaand done!” The earth pony punctuated the last word with a firm tap on the page. The maze froze, no longer swirling over the paper, and as Haze's eyes widened the pattern started to collapse in toward the center. In an instant, the page was bare. Pinkie looked up, locking eyes with the unicorn. Her eyes were different now, still distant but full of swirling toxic black, the shade that nightmares lived in. </p><p>“FINISHED.” The word wasn't loud in the air, but roared with magical energy, enough to make the whole room shake. Haze felt it hit him, felt it run through his mind like a hurricane, tearing every thought out of him like leaves off a tree. He had just enough time to panic, then feel himself twitch, then...</p><hr/><p>Pinkie blinked groggily. The world felt vague and floaty around her, as if her mind couldn't quite decide what it or any of the things around it were. But slowly, things started to come back into focus visually and mentally, the blur of colors correcting itself into actual things. A thing. A wall. </p><p>“Hi wall!”</p><p>Pinkie waved, then blinked as she heard herself. The words sounded a little less cheerful than she had meant, but she decided that was OK. The wall would understand. Her eyes darted around, quickly taking in the wall's surroundings. Sugar Cube Corner. That was a good place to be. She couldn't remember exactly what she had been doing, but that was OK. It was probably something great! </p><p>But what HAD she been doing? She paced in front of the counter, grabbing a cupcake to help her think.   Cupcake, frosting, ring-ding-ding-</p><p>“Oh right!” The unicorn! “Haze? Haaaaze? Haaa-oh!”</p><p>There he was. Standing right next to the wall she had met earlier. She bounced forward, holding out a hoof. “Sorry about that I was goooone for a moment. That happens sometimes I'll be here and then not here and then somewhere else. But I always come back, so it's fine! Sorry to leave ya hanging though, anything look good?”</p><p>No response.</p><p>“Haze? Mysterious Unicorn Guy?” Nothing.  A little worried, the pink pony stepped closer, giving the unmoving unicorn a nudge. “Hey can you hear me?”</p><p>“Yes.” The word was blank and emotionless, and Pinkie shivered a little at the sound. For the first time,  she noticed his eyes: blank and unfocused, staring into the empty space behind her. Her eyes widened as recognition dawned over the pink pony's face. This looked exactly like-</p><p>“Trance! You're in a trance! Oh my gosh that must have been what you were looking for when you said you were looking for something! Somepony cursed you and you're trying to uncurse yourself but now you're stuck!”</p><p>In a pink blur she was at his side, squeezing the vacantly-staring unicorn very, very hard. “Don't worry, help is on the way! Or really we're on the way, on the way to Twilight's! I don't always understand her, or pay attention to her, or take her advice and between you and me I think she likes books just a liiitle too much but she's a good friend and she's really smart and if anyone can fix you up she'll know!”</p><p>The pink pony attempted to drag Haze toward the door, but quickly discovered just how hard it was to move an unresponsive unicorn two hands taller than her and switched strategies. </p><p>“Don't worry, just stay right there unicorn guy. I'll bring Twilight to you! She isn't cursed so she can just walk!” The earth pony eagerly bounced toward the door. But as her hoof reached for the knob it stopped, hovered a moment, and dropped. She turned, looking back at Haze a moment, as if something was pulling her back. And as her eyes roamed over oblivious unicorn, still standing where she had left him, still staring into nothingness, a strange feeling crept into the back of her mind. </p><p>“Although, I suppose it couldn't hurt to check,” She said slowly, stepping back to Haze. “Just to be sure it really is a trance.” The earth pony thought a moment, then- “Lift your hoof.” </p><p>The unicorn stiffly raised his right hoof. “And put it down.” Again, Haze obeyed. Well, that was that, time got get Twilight and get all this fixed and whoooaha, there was that feeling again! For some reason, she really, really wanted to try another test. Like-</p><p>The earth pony motioned in front of the 'cursed' unicorn's face. “Walk in in a circle, in the center of the shop.” Haze slowly rose, began to walk forward and did as commanded, staring ahead into nothing as he slowly circled the floor. Pinkie trembled a little. There it was again, unmistakable. She did want to do this. Because doing it, because telling the unicorn what to do and seeing him obey felt...good?REALLY good actually. Like the smell of the best hot pastry ever coming out of the oven and the scent of sugar hitting her face, filling her nose, rushing into her brain. </p><p>What the heck was going on? The earth pony gasped suddenly, slapping a hoof to her head in embarrassment. Of course, it was a curse! The curse was spreading! She had to get Twilight fast, who knew where this was going to end up!</p><p>Yup, time to get Twilight. Pinkie watched the unicorn mindlessly trace his path around the store, blank, helpless, obedient. Time to get Twilight. Time. To. Go.</p><p>Pinkie stayed right where she was.</p><p>She couldn't take her eyes off the unicorn, still mindlessly circling. Couldn't stop thinking about helpless he was, how completely obedient to any command. Couldn't stop thinking about the commands she could give him. Better commands. She realized the feeling running through her wasn't like pastry at all. It was like the end of a really good prank, the look of surprise and dismay on the victim's face. That feeling of power and control. That spark of joy from watching another pony suffer. Always in fun, always just a little. But now...Now so much more!</p><p>On his next circuit the pink pony intercepted Haze with a hoof out. “Stop!” The unicorn immediately froze. Pinkie hesitated a moment, then “Bow.”</p><p>The unicorn immediately complied, lowering his head toward the ground, front legs stretched out in front of him. Pinkie trembled again, much more noticeably now. Mmmm, perfect. “Haze, look at me...” The unicorn's head tilted up, and as his eyes met hers, so blank and helpless, so vulnerable, the earth pony felt her the last shreds of her hesitation melt like an ice cube on a frying pan. Slowly, she extended her hoof to him, until it was up against his nose. She paused, the moment hanging in the air for a long, long few moment, then-</p><p>“Lick.”</p><p>The unicorn's tongue was out almost before Pinkie realized it. The moment it slid across Pinkie's hoof she gave a quiet moan. OoooohCelestiayeeeess! She tilted and turned the hoof, raised and lowered it, watching in fascination as the obedient unicorn followed its every move. Good unicorn. Lick it. Lick it clean! She stepped back and he followed. She pressed forward and he retreated. She tried to hold him back and he struggled to reach the hoof. Simply, obediently following the lead.</p><p>Like a good little puppet.</p><p>Another tremble. Her whole body was high on the rush of it now, the joy of watching the helpless unicorn dance for her. As her free hoof came to the back of the unicorn's head to guide him, tracing briefly over his horn, a cruel thought formed in Pinkie's mind. The fact that he was a unicorn made all this even better. She had never had any resentment toward unicorns in the past, but suddenly it felt very good to put one in his place. All that magic, all the schooling and money and fame that they had. So high and mighty and special. That magic's doing ya a lot of good now, isn't it hoof cleaner?</p><p>Pinkie blinked. Where was this coming from? Why was she so mean all of a sudden? Why did it feel so good to be mean? Hadn't she been about to do something important? But then another stroke of the unicorn's tongue rolled over the frog of her hoof and all the pesky questions melted away with a contented moan. It didn't matter, it didn't matter at all. More of this! More! MORE!</p><p>With a cruel grin the earth pony held her hoof out in front of the helpless unicorn like a carrot, guiding him to the counter. Then up and half over it, until he was laying on his stomach, legs resting limp against the floor. “That's enough, no more licking.” Haze drew his tongue back and waited, laying still across the counter. Pinkie disappeared into the back of the shop a moment, then was back, holding a long, thick wooden mixing spoon. The unusually long handle and narrow end made it look almost like a riding crop.</p><p>“Raise your tail Haze-” Pinkie ordered, a cruel sparkle in her eyes now to match her grin as she circled behind the unicorn, softly tracing his rear with the spoon a moment, then bringing it up and back. “Let's find out what sound a unicorn makes!”</p><p>There was a loud swish as the spoon cut the air, a nice, fleshy SMACK as it hit Haze's flank and then, to Pinkie's disappointment, nothing else. The earth pony blinked. Oh, right. He wasn't going to react unless she told him to. Such a good unicorn!</p><p>The earth pony leaned down, whispering to Haze. “The next time that spoon comes down...” She savored the moment for a beat- “squeal like a bitch. Got it?” The unicorn nodded roboticly. </p><p>Pinkie pulled her self back up, wound up the spoon again, and gave another swing. </p><p>Swish!</p><p>SMACK!</p><p>The unicorn gave a long, agonized yelp. Pinkie moaned happily at the sound. Perfect. </p><p>The next few minutes were a blur. The earth pony laid in hard to Haze, the sound of the spoon connecting with pony flesh again and again echoing through the shop, perfectly mixed with the unicorn's pathetic bleats of pain. Pinkie was panting now, and she could feel the pleasure inside her building to a peak. The pink pony was a runaway train now, and she wasn't going to stop until she jumped the tracks, hurtled off the trestle and exploded in the ravine below.  SMACK! SMACK! Any moment now, any moment, any-</p><p>“AAAAahaahaaaahaa!” Oooooh yes, there it was. The earth pony's eyes rolled back in bliss, spoon tumbling from her hoof as she collapsed onto the counter beside the unicorn, twitching in delight. </p><p>“Wow, that was great!” The earth pony murmured happily against the counter. Her mouth slipped slipped back into the sinister grin. “I wonder if-” </p><p>Pinkie froze mid-sentence, giving a little grunt as she felt something inside her mind shift, like something heavy snapping into place. She blinked, then shook her head, dismissing it and trying to remember what she had be plotting next. </p><p>She only had a moment to feel the next sensation. It was very subtle, just a little tug at the back of her mind. And then, just as she was starting to react, a much firmer one, and everything rushed away, away and out, the whole world slipping away. Pinkie tried to focus, but there was nothing to grab on to. In an instant a disintegrating chain of thoughts flashed through her mind.</p><p>Why was she trying to focus?</p><p>What was focus?</p><p>Who was she?</p><p>Everything was so light and floaty...</p><p>Light and floaty...</p><p>lightandfloaty...</p><p>... </p><hr/><p>Haze gave a load groan. His head felt like somepony had run it into a wall and...god, his ass! What on earth?! He tried to move, but his body felt heavy and sore, and it took several attempts before his front hooves started taking orders again. As he clumsily scrambled to right himself he began to take stock of where he was. Was he...laying over the counter? What?</p><p>With more struggling he managed to push himself off the counter, only to slide on to the floor with a painful THUD. With some muttered obscenities the unicorn finally pulled himself up and looked around the shop, finally noticing Pinkie laying limply across the counter as he had been a moment ago. There were suddenly many, many questions to be answered, but one quickly came to the front, and Haze's eyes raced across the shop, finally finding the book, discarded on the floor a few feet away. Rushing to it, he flipped through, past the cutie marks of the animal lover, the farmer, the seamstress. He let out a relieved sigh at the following page. The tangled lines of the maze had returned, and deep in their heart the baker's three balloons were firmly etched. Well, there was that at least.</p><p>Rubbing a hoof over his aching rear, Haze limped back to Pinkie. With a hard shove he rolled her over to lay on her back, then stepped behind the counter, lowering his head to hers, his voice dripping with malice.</p><p>“What happened after the maze Pinkie?” </p><hr/><p>Haze shook his head as the earth pony finished his last question. She was even stranger than he had read. He should have expected something like this, bringing two things like her and the book together. But the worried look soon melted back to the familiar cruel smile. In the end, the book had been just a bit stranger, and now he had a helpless pink pony waiting for him. Waiting for some payback for his poor flank. Drawing the book to him and opening to the earth pony's page again, he pulled out a quill and started to write. Time to make some revisions. </p><p>The changes were simple, and a moment later the unicorn was done, blowing over the ink to be sure it had dried into the page before he closed the book. Haze looked up at the vacant pony with an unsettling smile. </p><p>“Now then-”</p><hr/><p>The bell over the door at Sugar Cube Corner gave a friendly ring as a customer entered. “Hey there!” Pinkie called out in a voice as bouncy and friendly as her hair, waving to the unicorn stepping through the door. “Welcome to Sugar Cube Corner! Anything I can get for you? I've got some amaaaaazing cookies coming in just a few minutes, hot and fresh! Or if you like-” Before Pinkie could finish the sentence, Haze gave a short, two-note whistle.</p><p>The earth pony froze. Every inch of her body perfectly still, hoof still hovering in the gesture she had been making, cheerful face now gazing unseeing out into the space where Haze had been a moment ago. He had stepped closer now, right up against the baker, and he pressed his nose to her hair, taking in the scent and slowly running his tongue over the helpless pony's neck. </p><p>“You don't taste nearly as sweet as I expected.” He whispered into Pinkie's ear. The earth pony just kept smiling dumbly into open space. Haze reached out with his magic, pulling a familiar wooden spoon off the counter. Another bit of magical aura brushed Pinkie's tail up and to the side, leaving her rear bare and open. “Since you seem to like this so much-” The spoon came down on her ass with a hard SMACK that echoed through the shop. Glancing back, Haze noted with satisfaction that he had left a nice red mark. Setting the spoon back on the counter and stepping back to his former position in front of the frozen pony, the unicorn gave the same two-note whistle, and Pinkie sprang to life again.</p><p>“-I could-aaIIIIII!” Haze gave a pleased grin as the baker gave a painful yelp of surprise, jumping a good two feet into the air. Pinkie quickly looked behind her, trying to sooth her rear with one hoof while her mind struggled to process what had just happened. </p><p>“Something wrong Pinkie?”</p><p>“I uh, nope, everything is fine-” The pony laughed nervously, looking a little confused. “I just, just now there was a-” She looked back again at the spoon lying on the counter. “Hmmm. Say, how do you know my name? We haven't met yet, or we're just meeting now I mean, and I usually remember that kind of thing.”</p><p>“Oh I know a lot of things Pinkie. I wouldn't worry about it.”</p><p>She laughed. “Boy, you gotta work on that, it sounds really sinister.” He smiled, sinisterly of course. “I'll keep that in mind. Say Pinkie?”</p><p>“Mmm?”</p><p>“Can you say 'Aaaaa?'” The unicorn opened his mouth wide for effect. Pinkie giggled at this. “What? Well of course I can silly. AaAaa-”</p><p>Whistle.</p><p>The baker froze again, mouth wide open and smiling, tongue out just a bit. Haze chuckled as he stepped up to the earth pony. “Enthusiastic aren't you? Well then-” He circled around behind her, one hoof on her back knees, the other on her rear, gently pressing down. Pinkie's body followed the pressure, easily coming to a sitting position. Stepping back in front of his new toy, the unicorn held a hoof to her forehead, pressing down until her face was level with his chest. She was sitting just in front of the counter now, and when Haze rested his front hooves on the counter it brought him into exactly the position he was looking for, the growing length between his legs hovering just in front of Pinkie's helpless, wide open mouth. </p><p>Reaching back with one hoof he raised the growing member, resting its wide, warm tip on the earth pony's outstretched tongue and gasping in appreciation at the warm, wet sensation. Slowly he pressed his hips forward, grunting happily as he felt himself sink into the welcoming tightness of the earth pony's mouth. Just as his medial ring started to approach her lips, the unicorn pulled back, all the way until his tip was on her tongue, then rolled his hips forward again, starting to fuck the frozen pony with a slow, gliding rhythm. </p><p>Before long he was at full length, and the unicorn grinned as he felt pre drool out onto the pink pony's tongue. He had only gone as far her mouth, but now he started to tease the back of her throat his thick, warm head, deeper, deeper, and then pushed past it, into her throat. Pinkie gave a muffled gagging sound, but didn't move, and Haze began to roll his hips in earnest again, moaning happily each time his  head buried itself in her throat, deeper and deeper with each thrust until at last he felt his balls press against her chin. All the way in. </p><p>The unicorn ground against Pinkie a moment, then left his length where it was. The earth pony started to gag again, and Haze groaned in pleasure as her tight throat twitched and squeezed around him, the rest of her body starting to jerk a little beneath him in involuntary rejection. Her mind was blank, but the pink pony's body clearly still wanted him gone, and its feeble attempts to clear her throat felt fantastic. For a brief instant Haze considered keeping his length where it was until she stopped twitching for good, but he quickly discarded the idea. As much as he was enjoying this, and as good as it was to hear and feel the babbling pink pony gagging on him, she was far too valuable to kill, at least for now. They all were.<br/>At last he pulled back, and Pinkie's body gasped, dragging in the air it so desperately needed. He gave it just enough time to quiet down, then pressed in again. The unicorn could feel himself getting close. Time to finish this. </p><p>He began to roll his hips again, but the motion was faster this time, rougher and less restrained. Each thrust pushed just past the back of Pinkie's throat, then back to the front of her mouth, then in again. Faster, harder! Haze moaned, louder now, half from the pleasure and half from the wonderful, wet sounds of mouth fucking coming from under him. Harder, harder! As his hips moved in a blur he felt the climax coming. His eyes pressed shut, muzzle twisting in tension, hooves gripping the counter tight as his whole body tensed in anticipation of the coming release. One thrust, two three-And Haze cried out, almost snarling as the climax hit and he felt his length throb deep inside the frozen pony beneath him.</p><p>The first and second pulse went straight down her throat. The second, third and fourth came inside her mouth, quickly filling it and dripping past her lips and down her chin. By the fifth and sixth he had pulled out, and the last bursts splashed sloppily across her face. </p><p>Haze gasped, taking a moment to come down from the pleasure rolling through him, then slowly lowered himself from the counter, stepping back to enjoy his handiwork. He couldn't stop himself from breaking into a laugh at the sight that greeted him. The earth pony looked so wonderfully stupid and pathetic, face plastered and dripping with seed, tongue marinating in it inside her mouth, and still happily gazing ahead at nothing, so utterly oblivious. </p><p>He couldn't resist.</p><p>Whistle.</p><p>A very strange set of sounds followed as Pinkie unfroze, tried to continue speaking and coughed on what was in her mouth. Finally clearing her throat, the pony raised a hoof to her cheek in confusion, pulling it away and examining the warm mess that stuck to it. “Huh? What the heck is this? Did one of the frosting tubes explode again?”</p><p>Haze suppressed a laugh. “You could say that.”</p><p>“Hey, wait-” the pink pony's eye's started to narrow. “This tastes really familiar...”</p><p>Whistle. </p><p>Haze stepped up to the mare, frozen in skeptical examination of her hoof, and ran his own hoof down  her neck. “Does it now? I wonder just how familiar you are with it Pinkie.” He eyed her rear, feeling his length stiffening again between his legs. </p><hr/><p>Pinkie lay on the floor in a tangled heap, legs splayed in strange directions like a forgotten toy. Her face was still frozen in a blank smile, cloudy white filth splattered across her cheeks, dripping from her open mouth. Her mane was a matted mess, pulled and tugged out of shape, and also dripping here and there.<br/>The other end was worse. The twisted angle of her legs hid the area from direct view, but the juices splattered across her flank were clear enough, slowly running down her pink rear to pool beneath her.</p><p>The unicorn stood over her, savoring the moment. Then, stepping up to the earth pony he grabbed her around the chest, lifting her front and slowly dragging her stiff body behind the counter. Slowly, his hooves worked over her body, raising her into a sitting position, angling her head, nudging her arms and hooves up and over, until she was in position, waving to a non-existent customer in front of her.  </p><p>The unicorn reached down, searching the shelves and drawers under the counter until his hoof returned with a rag. Wetting it in a near-by sink, he began to carefully clean the earth pony, leaving traces here and there, but removing all the most obvious stains and gently pushing her hair...roughly back into place.</p><p>Stepping back to the other side of the counter, Haze ran the rag over the mess on the floor,  then stepped back, appraising Pinkie. Rough, but workable. From a distance at least, the pink pony now just looked like she'd had a very hectic day. </p><p>Stepping up to the counter, Haze reached out with his magic, pulling something from one of the nearby shelves. With a gentle tug he pulled Pinkie's waving hoof down, turning it until it was held out, palm up, and set the object he had retrieved in her waiting hoof. </p><p>Then, stepping back, he gave a whistle with notes he hadn't used before. Pinkie gave a slight twitch, but remained in place. Haze stepped to the door, unlocking it and looking back at the pink pony one last time. Then he opened the door, and as he stepped out onto the street his lips pressed together, giving the familiar whistle just before the door closed behind him.</p><hr/><p>Pinkie blinked. What had she been doing? Her mind felt vague and fuzzy as she tried to remember.</p><p>As the world reformed around her, the baker noticed she was holding something and looked down. In her hoof was a cupcake, freshly frosted, with a large bite taken from one side.</p>

<p>The pegasus gritted her teeth. The air was cold this high up, and even colder at these speeds. Rain broke against her face as she tore through the air, the sky above her black with an angry storm. As lighting flashed across the sky in front of her, the brave pegasus felt fear start to twist in her gut. Fear she knew would turn to panic soon. Panic that would make a dangerous situation even worse. </p><p>She closed her eyes. Took a breath.</p><p>Breathe. Focus. Breathe. Focus. In and out. </p><p>The fear retreated. Quieted. She opened her eyes, scanning the clouds. As she did, the pegasus caught sight of her target again, a shadowy figure twisting back and forth between the clouds. She quickly darted after him, but for all her speed she could only just keep up. Over and over she came close to losing him altogether, only to catch a glimpse at the last moment, a malicious flicker darting behind cover. Her body strained, wings aching, throwing everything into the chase. Just a little closer, a little closer... </p><p>Somewhere nearby, a voice echoed faintly in the storm, meaning lost in the howling wind. Her eyes scanned the sky to either side, but only more churning black clouds met her gaze. The voice came again, her other side now, a little louder but still impossible to understand. But only empty air swirled through the space the voice had called from. </p><p>There it was again, to the right. To the left. Behind. Below. Louder, more shrill, howling sadly with the wind all around her. The pegasus felt herself tilt in the air, disoriented as the storm swirled around her, and as she started to tumble from the sky the sound finally came into focus.</p><p>“Rainbow!”</p><p>“Rainbow”</p><p>“Rainbow?”</p><p>With a very ungraceful spasm Rainbow Dash jolted several feet into the air from base of the tree she had been napping against. A slight turn and several groggy blinks slowly pulled the world back into focus. As it returned, Rainbow saw that a strange brown unicorn was looking at her curiously. </p><p>“Rainbow Dash? Are you alright? I didn't mean to startle you.”</p><p>Finally awake now, the sky-blue pegasus laughed. “Nah, no problem. Musta rolled over on something funny there.” She rolled her eyes dismissively, as if to emphasize just how not a problem it was. “You lookin' for me?”</p><p>“You're Rainbow Dash?”</p><p>The pegasus grinned, puffing her chest out a little. “One and the same.”</p><p>“Thank goodness. I have a friend that's a pretty big fan of yours. Won't stop talking about what you can do in the air. I only have a few days left in Ponyville, and I was starting to worry I wouldn't find you in time. But now that I have-” He pulled a small notepad and pen from his satchel. “would you mind an autograph?”<br/>Rainbow raised an eyebrow. Something was strange about the unicorn. His words were flustered and hurried, but he spoke them with a slow, slippery confidence, as if he had never been unsure of anything in his life. The mis-match was jarring. But Rainbow shook it off, smiling as she landed and stretched. “Sure, always glad to help a fan. Bein' fast is pretty great, but so is having people to root for you.”</p><br/><p>“Thanks.” The unicorn held out the open notepad and pen, the latter of which Rainbow grabbed with her teeth, grinning. “Sho, anyshing shpecial fho yo friend?”</p><p>The unicorn closed his eyes. “To my number one fan, keep flyin' fast. Rainbow Dash.” Rainbow smirked, lowering the pen to the page. But before she could start writing, the unicorn spoke again.</p><p>“To my number one fan, keep flyin' fast. Rainbow Dash.”</p><p>She looked up quizically. “Yheah I ghot ihh, thanks-” His eyes caught hers. Solid and unmoving. </p><p>“To my number one fan,<br/>Keep flyin' fast,<br/>-Rainbow Dash”</p><p>She opened the side of her mouth to ask a question, then stopped herself. There was something in the way the unicorn was saying the words-</p><p>“To my number one fan,<br/>Keep flyin' fast,<br/>-Rainbow Dash”</p><p>Yeah, there it was. Something with timing, like a poem or something. Weird. Why was he repeating it?And why-</p><p>“To my number one fan,<br/>Keep flyin' fast,<br/>-Rainbow Dash”</p><p>Yeah, they felt weird. The words felt weird. Slow and heavy, like flying with sandbags tied on for training. They kinda made everything slow and heavy, every time he-</p><p>“To my number one fan,<br/>Keep flyin' fast,<br/>-Rainbow Dash”</p><p>Was he talking slower now? Slower and heavier? Was something wrong? Should she go? Should she stop listening? She should, she had to get away from this- </p><p>“To my number one fan,<br/>Keep flyin' fast,<br/>-Rainbow Dash”</p><p>What was she doing right now? What had she been thinking just now? Why was it gone? Why did the words feel good? Why did the words feel so slow and heavy and good? Why did she feel so slow and heavy and good? Why-</p><p>“To my number one fan,<br/>Keep flyin' fast,<br/>-Rainbow Dash”</p><p>The words felt good. The rhythm felt good. The tone felt good. She felt good. Heavy and slow and good. She would listen and feel good. She would watch his eyes and feel good. Slow and heavy and good.</p><p>“To my number one fan,<br/>Keep flyin' fast,<br/>-Rainbow Dash.”</p><p>Good words. Good pony. Heavy pony. Slow pony. Good pony. </p><br/><p>“To my number one fan<br/>Rainbow Dash:<br/>Keep flyin' fast.”</p><p>Good pony. Good pony. Good...</p><p>&lt;&gt;</p><p>Haze stepped forward, picking up the pen that had dropped from the pegasai's limp mouth. Her body was frozen in a sitting position, utterly relaxed, glazed eyes staring into empty space where the unicorn had been. Grasping one of Rainbow's wings with his magic, the unicorn gently extended it, running a hoof down the feathers. “Lovely. You really are a gifted pegasus Rainbow.” Stepping in front of her, Haze tossed aside the autograph book, reaching into his satchel to pull out a much thicker volume. “I know you say you don't like books Rainbow-” He opened the book, holding the twisting pages in front of the flyer's vacant, smiling face. “But I promise, this one will be lots and lots of fun.”</p><hr/><p>[/hr]</p><p>“You wanna what?” The blue pegasus stared at the tawny yellow pony in front of her. </p><p>“Race.” The earth pony said with a friendly eagerness, smiling as he leaned forward a little. </p><p>Rainbow arched an eyebrow “Against the fastest pegasus in Ponyville?”</p><p>“Mmmhm! No wings, no magic. Just hooves on the ground!”</p><p>Rainbow gave the unicorn a credulous look. “Look, Golden Streak was it?” The pony nodded. “No offense, I'm sure you're pretty fast. But wings or not, I'm the fasted thing in Ponyville. Maybe the whole kingdom. It isn't going to be much of a race.” </p><p>Golden shrugged, still smiling good-naturedly “Even so, I want to take a shot at it. You don't really know how far you can go until you try, right?”</p><p>The pegasus grinned. “I like your style kid. Alright, we'll race. Don't say I didn't warn ya though.”</p><p>“Noted.”</p><p>“So where are we racing to hotshot?” The earth pony raised a hoof, pointing. “There's a mile marker a bit further down this road. How's that?”</p><p>“Alright.” Rainbow stepped out into the middle of the road, angling forward into a runner's start. Golden stepped up beside her, doing the same. “Your count kid. Less you wanna back out.” The pegasus teased. Golden shook his head with a grin.</p><p>“Three-”</p><p>“Two-”</p><p>“One-”</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>A haze of dust and debris exploded off the road as the race began. As it slowly settled, a dull-brown unicorn slowly stepped from it, watching as Raindow disappeared around a distant bend in the road. He  smiled, stretched, and began a slow, casual trot up the road. </p><p>A few minutes later the unicorn rounded the top of a small hill, smiling as he saw the pegasus waiting below. As he approached, Haze slowed to a walk, slowly taking in the view. At the foot of the hill, Rainbow Dash was frozen mid-run in the center of the road, legs bent dramatically against the ground, mouth spread in a confident grin. The unicorn stepped up to the motionless pegasus, stroking a hoof slowly across her flank. She was firm and strong under his touch, still warm from the eager sprint she had been plucked from moments ago.</p><p>Slowly the hoof traced further back, over and under until he felt the smooth skin of her sex. Gently he started to stroke and tease, leaning closer to hear her breath. At first it was barely audible, slow and steady like a pony peacefully asleep. His hoof played faster between her legs, harder. Her breath started to catch, slowly shifting to quiet gasps, then, finally, an eager, low panting. Through it all Rainbow's expression held, unchanged, but it was starting to twitch now. </p><p>He stroked deeper, quicker against her. He could feel her back legs starting to sway slightly, everything else still perfectly frozen in place. The panting breaths grew deeper, more frantic, desperate.</p><p>Closer.</p><p>Closer.</p><p>Closer-</p><p>Rainbow gave a long, low, quiet groan, her whole body trembling in its stiff pose. Haze stepped back, laughing as he caught sight of her face. Her expression had finally given up the fight, collapsing from eager competition to deep, obscene satisfaction. But her eyes remained as blank as before. </p><p>Haze raised his hoof, now dripping, from her mouth. </p><p>“Lick.”</p><p>The pegasus complied blankly, though her new expression made her look grateful as she carefully rolled her tongue over every inch of the slick hoof. When it was clean, Haze raised the hoof to her mane, ruffling the bright colors of the oblivious mare. “Good girl.” He leaned in a little closer, pressing his muzzle to hers in a long, deep kiss. Then up, to whisper in her ear.</p><p>“One hundred.”</p><p>“Ninety-nine-” the mare replied robotically, blank eyes still staring at the road ahead.   </p><p>“Ninety-eight. Ninety-seven. Ninety-six-”</p><p>Haze turned, strolling toward the finish line in no particular hurry.</p><hr/><p>[/hr]</p><p>Rainbow smiled as she felt the wind rush past her face. Flying was better than running any day, but as long as it was fast, she was happy. Warm sun shimmered off the leaves, dust rising from the road as she leaned into a curve. She glanced behind her, then laughed. Golden was nowhere to be seen. Oh well, had to admire his spirit at least. And hey, maybe some day he really would give her a good race. Today though, she'd have to be careful to not fall asleep before she made it to the finish line. </p><p>Suddenly a shot of heat raced through the pegasus. The world swirled in a disoriented mess for an instant, and Rainbow felt herself tumble forward, plowing into the road in front of her face-first. </p><p>Wincing, she slowly picked herself up. Nothing felt really injured, just tender. What the heck was that? As the stun of the impact started to wear off she noticed her body felt warm, not intensely like it had moments ago, just a gentle kind of...glow? </p><p>Had she caught something? She had stayed out in that thunderstorm last week a little longer than usual. Well, all day really. She shook her head. Nothing to worry about. Not for now anyway. She had a race to win! Rainbow glanced back at the road behind her. Still no Golden. Good. She grinned. Time to finish this then. And then take a nap on the finish line while she waited for her competitor.</p><hr/><p>[/hr]</p><p>Rainbow's eyes were wide. Her jaw hung open, limp. Silent.</p><p>For a few seconds.</p><p>“H-how, what, wha-”</p><p>Golden was on the other side of the finish line. Golden was WAITING on the other side. Golden had-</p><p>“You won?! How?! You never even passed me!”</p><p>“Sure I did. I came around that bend and you were waiting. Said you'd give me a head-start to even the odds a little. Remember?”</p><p>Rainbow gave the yellow pony a confused look. “No I didn't, you never- I- you...”</p><p>The pegasus twitched a little. The world shimmered in front of her an instant, then snapped back. She blinked. “Oh yeah. Yeah I did.” How had she forgotten that? But still-“But that was at the beginning of the race! There's no way you beat me here! I would have lapped you twice at the speed you were going!” The yellow pony smiled gently. “Are you sure? After all, I mean-” He looked down at the finish line. The line with him on one side, and her on the other. </p><p>“No!” She stepped up to the friendly, smiling earth pony “Look, I know speed. I know fast. And you just weren't going fast enough to-”</p><p>She felt herself twitch again, harder this time. The strangest sensation ran through her mind; like trying to grab something and discovering it just wasn't there.  There was a moment of silence before Rainbow spoke again, a little more relaxed now.</p><p>“No, no you're right. I can see how you might have passed me. Heh, and anyway, no reason to be a sore loser. Congrads kid, you beat me. Just uh-” she glanced to the side ”let's keep this between us, OK?” These last words were said in a suddenly severe tone and expression that implied injury was likely if Golden didn't comply.</p><p>But he smiled cheerfully “No problem. ”</p><p>Rainbow smiled. “Cool. Well, I'm outta here. ” She stepped past the earth pony, preparing to head skyward again.</p><p>“Say Rainbow, have you ever heard of the gold wing oath?”</p><p>The pegasus stopped dead. “n-No...”</p><p>“Really? You've never head of the universal pledge pegasai make? That the winner of a race can ask the loser to do any test of endurance he chooses?”</p><p>Rainbow turned “How do you know about about it?” <br/>Golden stepped up, uncomfortably close now, ignoring the question. “Are you going honor the oath Rainbow.”</p><p>“Look, you can't just-”</p><p>“Really? From what I was told it's not restricted to pegasai. Anyone who beats a pegasus has the right to ask. Isn't that true?”</p><p>Rainbow noticed Golden was starting to step toward her, and stepped back. “This was your plan all along!”</p><p>“Does it matter? Does that change the rules?” Rainbow's flank pressed up against a tree. No more backing up. Golden stepped closer. “Are you going to break your promise Rainbow?”</p><br/><p>The pegasus glared at Golden in silence. But after a moment her gaze finally sunk to the ground.<br/>“Fine. What stupid crap do you want me to do, pushups or something?”</p><p>“Not quite. You just need to hold still for a few minutes.” She raised an eyebrow. He circled around behind her, resting a hoof on her flank. “And not orgasm.”</p><p>“WHAT?!”</p><p>Golden continued, utterly calm. “For the next few minutes, I'm going to try to make you come. All you have to do is hold back until I finish.”  </p><p>Rainbow wheeled to face Golden, her face the picture of rage. “That's not what the oath is for!”</p><p>“Is there a rule against it?”</p><p>“THAT'S NOT-”</p><p>“Is there?”</p><p>“No, but-”</p><p>Golden stepped forward, grabbing Rainbow's jaw and looking her in the eye. “Then stop making excuses.”</p><p>He stepped back. “Are you going to break your promise Rainbow?”</p><p>She stared at him, mind racing. Then looked down. </p><p>“No.” </p><p>“Good. Now turn around.”</p><p>Resentfully the pegasus obeyed, turning her rear to face Golden.</p><p>“Raise your tail.”</p><p>She shot him a look of pure hatred at this, but he only smiled. With an angry grunt she did as commanded, raising her tail up and to the side, giving the earth pony a good, full view of everything between her legs.</p><p>She felt him step up behind her, felt his warmth against her. His broad hoof traced down her back. It felt smooth, polished. Cool. It made its way around her tail. Under. She gave a small gasp as it found her sex, gently stroking against the lips, teasing, circling. </p><p>“Enjoying it already? You should pace yourself Rainbow.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The earth pony only gave a quiet chuckle at this. His hoof kept up its work, teasing and swirling over the sensitive skin. As it did she felt his other hoof press against her flank, kneading the athletic muscle under the lightning bolt. Both hooves tending to their tasks slowly, firmly, in no particular hurry as they toyed with her. Mentally Rainbow scoffed. He expected to get a reaction with this?  But the hooves kept up their work, stroking and massaging, minute by minute, and before long a gentle warmth started to spread between Rainbow's legs, subtle but deep and growing stronger with each stroke of that hoof. </p><p>The hoof at her flank moved to her wings, slowly spreading them, stroking over the edge as they extended, first the right, then the left. </p><p>“h-Hey, what are you-” And then the earth pony's teeth followed. “Ghaaah!”</p><p>Rainbow failed to hold back a surprised moan as Golden's mouth worked over her sensitive wings, mostly in teasing nibbles, sometimes harder, tugging bites. The pegasus realized she was panting. When had that started? She could feel the please glowing through every inch of her, and getting worse by the second. She could feel-she could HEAR that she was wet against his hoof now, and it was teasing deeper into her, moving a little quicker.  This was bad. She couldn't be this turned on already. She couldn't lose a second time. She WOULDN'T. </p><p>Breathe. Focus. Breathe. Focus. </p><p>Underneath the moans and gasps Rainbow struggled against the growing pleasure. She smiled slightly as the storm raging through her calmed slightly, balanced. She had it! She could hold it like this, as long as she needed to. As long as it took for that smug earth pony to admit defeat. Just breathe and focus, breath and focus. </p><p>Rainbow didn't notice when the hoof left her flank. Only when it came back down, hitting with a firm, sharp SMACK. She yelped, jolting forward slightly, then gasped. The brief jolt of pain had broken her concentration and in those few seconds-OH GOD in those few seconds she had started to feel much much better. </p><p>SMACK!</p><p>No no no, focus, breathe-</p><p>SMACK!</p><p>Guuh! Focus, breathe, focus-</p><p>SMACK!</p><p>Focus, focus!</p><p>SMACK! SMACK!</p><p>Oh gOOOHD!</p><p>SMACK!</p><p>It felt so good! So goooood! Tumbling twisting falling pleasure everywhere. Everywhere!</p><p>SMACK!</p><p>“Nhoo, plheese, nhoo mhore, nho mohhre I'll-”</p><p>SMACK!</p><p>“I'll-”</p><p>SMACK!</p><p>“I'll-”</p><p>The hoof between her legs ground into her like it was possessed.</p><p>“Nho...”</p><p>SMACK!</p><p>“GHAAAAAAAAH!”</p><p>Rainbow twisted in pleasure as the orgasm ran through her,  first with one long, obscene yell, grinding back against the earth pony, then, as the climax finished, a low, defeated groan. When there was no air left in her lungs, the pegasus collapsed, sprawling onto the ground. Her chest heaved, legs twitching now and then as the aftershocks of the orgasm toyed with her.</p><p>Golden stepped forward, reaching down to gently turn Rainbow's head toward him. “Looks like I win. And what does that mean Rainbow?”</p><p>When she spoke, there was no trace of defiance left in the pegasai's voice. It was exhausted, defeated. </p><p>“I-i have to be y-your servant.” </p><p>“Slave.” Golden corrected, gently stroking the defeated pegasai's head. “You have to be my slave.”</p><p>Rainbow nodded, long past refusing anything the earth pony said now. “Slave.” She repeated limply.</p><p>Golden smiled. “Good. Now spread your legs slave. I want to enjoy my prize.”</p><p>Weakly she complied, rolling onto her back and spreading herself for her new owner. As he pressed against her slick sex, she was dimly aware that something in her had broken in the orgasm, something final. But it didn't matter now. All that mattered now was what Golden was about to give her. She smiled up at him eagerly. Whispered.</p><p>“Please...more...”</p><hr/><p>[/hr]</p><p>In a clearing some distance off the road, the afternoon sun played through the leaves, shadows dancing over a blue pegasus sprawled at the base of a large oak. </p><p>Her coat was ragged and matted, covered in dust and grass stains, her wings a mess of tangled feathers, her brightly colored mane and tail a mess, scattered and stained with something. She lay still, save only the gentle rise and fall of her chest. </p><p>A unicorn was stooping over her. He straightened, reaching out with his magic to grab a book from the grass beside her.  And then, with one last look at the sleeping pegasus, he turned to go. </p><p>A moment after he was gone, the pegasus shifted in her sleep, legs moving slightly. As they did, a faint, cloudy-white trickle ran down her thigh, pooling on the ground beneath her.</p>

<p>Dust motes hung in the afternoon sun as it shone through the only window in the Golden Oak library's reference and research section. Just out of range of the warm beams, a small dragon sat on the floor, arms folded, staring straight ahead with simmering annoyance. His lower half was covered in a snow-drift of crumpled papers, and as he sank deeper into the annoyance another ball of rejected writing bounced off his head to join the pile. He shook himself, scattering the papers, and turned to the purple unicorn leaning over the desk next to him. </p><p>&quot;Twilight, you've been writing all morning! It's just an invitation.&quot;</p><p>The purple unicorn sitting at the desk next to him didn't look up. &quot;It has to be just right Spike. I don't want this to sound dumb.&quot;</p><p>The dragon sighed. &quot;I know you want the book reading to be great, and that you've been planning it for weeks. And it WILL be great.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because I've been planning it for weeks?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because your friends will be glad to come. And because the book is great-&quot; He looked up at the volume next to her on the table, The Magic of Trust. &quot;Who WOULDN'T want to know how an earth pony could trick everyone into thinking he was a unicorn long enough to graduate from a Canterlot magic school!&quot; He glanced down, seeing one of the crumpled balls stuck in his tail and bent down to pull it out. Twilight finally looked up, watching him with a smile. &quot;You're right. All I need is something simple. Thanks Spike.&quot; She turned back, raising her quick to write the final draft. &quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p>The dragon looked up. &quot;What?&quot; Twilight laughed nervously. &quot;I'm out of ink. It looks like I used the last of it on the one I just crumpled up. The dragon sighed again, but he was smiling. &quot;Don't worry, already on it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just the two-bit kind, right?&quot; He called as he headed for the door. </p><p>&quot;Yes, thank you!&quot; </p><p>&quot;Got it!&quot; </p><p>Twilight heard the door open and close, and turned to one of the nearby shelves. Might as well do some research while she waited. Eyes scanning the selection, she pulled half a dozen books from their places and set them on the desk with a satisfying thud. </p><p>*******</p><br/><p>&quot;Excuse me-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gwaaah!&quot; Twilight started, almost jumping out of her chair at the sudden voice in her ear. Turning, she saw a dusty brown unicorn <br/>looking back at her, a little worried now. &quot;Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Is this the Golden Oak Library?&quot; </p><p>&quot;Yes, yes it is. That's right!&quot; Twilight said, much too quickly and a pitch or two higher than was ideal. She coughed, bringing her <br/>voice down to something more professional, and continued. &quot;Sorry, I must not have heard you come in. Twilight Sparkle.&quot; She held out a hoof. The unicorn shook it. &quot;Haze.&quot; He glanced down to the pile of crumpled paper. &quot;Working on something?&quot; Suddenly remembering the mess surrounding her and the piles of open books on the desk, one of which she had apparently been sleeping on, the purple unicorn gave a nervous laugh, shoving all of it to one side without looking at it. &quot;Nothing important, just some research. What can I help you with?&quot;</p><p>&quot;This.&quot;</p><p>From his pack, the unicorn drew a thick, heavy book, setting it on the desk in front of Twilight. She leaned closer, inspecting it. The leather binding was old and worn, but sturdy. She could see no signs of tearing along the edge or spine. The pages were uneven, not neatly trimmed, and they looked yellowed, but only slightly. There was not title on the front or spine, no markings at all, just the smooth, ordinary leather. But even at a glance, she could tell there was something more going on, and as she turned it on the desk she felt the magic she had expected, a cold, subtle energy swirling beneath the leather.</p><p>&quot;Enchanted.&quot; She continued turning it in her hooves.</p><p>&quot;Yes. What can you tell me about it?&quot;</p><p>She lifted it slightly, turned it over. &quot;Not much. There's definitely magic here, and a whole lot of it. It isn't a simple gimmick or gag like children like to use for pranks sometimes. It's woven much deeper in.&quot; She stroked a hoof across the cover in small circles. <br/>&quot;And it feels...strange. Not like an enchantment should.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Enchantments are usually like ornaments, like adding a little bit of clockwork on to something. Simple and functional. This is huge, and it's almost like the enchantment is just there as...containment, or a holder for something else.&quot; She pushed it away. &quot;Without any markings that's as much as I can get from the outside though. Have you ever opened it?&quot;</p><p>The unicorn shook his head. Twilight nodded. &quot;That was probably a good idea. A very good idea. Hold on-&quot; She reached onto the shelf behind her, pulling out several smooth, flat stones, each a little smaller that a hoof and jet black. With a deft movement she quickly laid them out around the book, and when the last stone was in place strange symbols appeared on each, glowing a gentle blue. <br/>&quot;For protection-&quot; She gestured to the stones. &quot;They filter any magic cast through them and neutralize and contain anything dangerous. SO great for researching ancient magic artifacts.&quot; Twilight grinned. &quot;Even so, I wouldn't normally trust them with something this strange, but these are custom made by one of the best unicorns in the craft in Canterlot. These things could even stop a lot of Celestia's magic!&quot; Twilight stopped, suddenly realizing how much of a magic nerd she was being, and coughed. &quot;Anyway, let's give this a try.&quot;</p><p>Slowly, her hoof moved to open the book, grasping the cover, carefully pulling it back-</p><p>Haze's hoof pressed down on hers, closing the book. She looked up to him, confused.</p><p>&quot;Before you look inside, there is one other thing you should see.&quot; He held out a worn piece of paper, very yellowed and covered in fold lines. Twilight pulled a soft pad from the nearby shelf, the kind she used for re-conditioning books, and laid out the paper, carefully opening it. A poem was scrawled across the fragile surface in harsh, jagged strokes. Her eyes traced the lines...</p><br/><p><i>Inside the patch the rabbit fled </i><br/><i>Inside the patch the rabbit bled</i></p><p><i>Ran from wolf's teeth, dripping red</i><br/><i>caught by briar's teeth instead</i></p><p><i>Round the ankle, holding fast</i><br/><i>Round the neck that pulled and gasped</i></p><p><i>Harder did it twist and pull</i><br/><i>Deeper did they thrust and go</i></p><p><i>No escape by foot or ear.</i><br/><i>No escape from strangling fear.</i></p><p><i>Till it hung still in briar's teeth</i><br/><i>It's life pooled on the ground beneath</i></p><p><i>To flee the patch the rabbit tried</i><br/><i>To flee the patch the rabbit died </i></p><p>As she finished the poem, Twilight felt something run through her, cold and uncomfortable. Then it was gone. She turned the paper slightly, looking it over carefully. &quot;Where did you find this?&quot;</p><p>Haze stepped up behind her, looking over her shoulder. &quot;With the book.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Strange.&quot; She thought a moment, hoof hovering over the lines. &quot;I'm not recognizing this poem, but the paper is old. Really old. Most ponies stopped making it like this over a century ago. I wonder-&quot;</p><p>&quot;To flee the patch the rabbit tried&quot; The unicorn behind her softly intoned.</p><p>&quot;To flee the patch the rabbit died&quot; Twilight murmured, eyes lidding slightly for a moment, then blinking as she smiled enthusiastically. &quot;Wait, I think I might have something on this. Something I saw in the archives a few weeks ago.&quot; The purple unicorn started off at a brisk pace. Haze followed close behind, then beside her for a moment, speaking again.</p><p>&quot;To flee the patch the rabbit tried.&quot; </p><p>&quot;To flee the patch the rabbit died&quot; Twilight murmured, eyes sinking again for a moment, then springing back open. She continued walking, leading Haze deeper and deeper into the far section of the library. At last they reached a shelf, and Twilight ran a hoof through the volumes. &quot;I think it was right about here...&quot;</p><br/><p><i>To flee the patch the rabbit tried</i><br/><i>To flee the patch the rabbit died. </i></p><p>&quot;Yes! Here it is!&quot; Twilight pulled out a worn yellow volume, flipping through it quickly until she came to an entry titled &quot;Rites of the Mountain Tribes.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I thought that idea sounded familiar! Listen to this-&quot; Twilight raised a hoof as she started to read.</p><p><i>&quot;Little is known of this remote mountain people, even what their real name is or the exact mountain they live under. Reports conflict on most details, but converge on one aspect of their culture: The myth of the rabbit. Found repeatedly in various forms through all accounts, this archetypal story tells of of a rabbit that escapes a wolf through confusion and trickery. It is perhaps fitting that the mountain tribe, like their totem, continue to evade researchers and explorers to this day.&quot;</i></p><p>Twilight turned, triumphant. &quot;I knew that sounded familiar. Now let's-&quot;</p><p>Haze wasn't behind her anymore. &quot;Haze?&quot; Her head swung quickly back and forth, scanning the area. Haze was gone.</p><p>&quot;Haze?&quot; She took a step forward, and stopped. Her hooves weren't making a sound on the wooden floor anymore. Nothing was. Not the birds outside, not the slow, constant creak of the tree that had kept her up for weeks when she first moved here. Everything was dead silent. She looked down at her hooves, and immediately regretted it. Everything looked as it should, but as her head tilted down she <br/>was seized by a sickening sense of vertigo, as if she was teetering on an edge high, high in the air, looking down. Teetering, and then tilting. Falling towards the fast-approaching ground. She tried to scream, but there was no sound now, not even her voice. Down and down, faster and faster at the ground. Until she hit. Hit and went right through, and darkness wrapped around her.</p><p>She opened her eyes.</p><p>Everything was dim, dark shapes. Vague and confusing, like her eyes wouldn't focus. She was standing. She felt cold, cold and stiff. There was a pony shape in front of her. It spoke.</p><p>&quot;No escape by foot or ear&quot;</p><p>&quot;No escape from strangling fear&quot; She heard herself reply. The words fill her with inexplicable dread, but her voice was flat and even. Blank.</p><p>A notebook appeared in front of her, held in the air. A quill next to it. </p><p>&quot;Bleed.&quot;</p><p>Her hoof moved to the quill, shifted it to the page, began to write. Strange symbols, shapes, notches and curls. Nothing that Twilight could recognize. But she knew what she was writing. She could feel it flowing out of her, through the hoof and on to the paper. Magic. Every defensive spell she knew, every counter, every way of fighting a magical conflict. All embedded now on this page, glowing. And only on this page, she realized. She couldn't remember them any more when she tried, only when she gazed at the symbols. Writing and writing until there was nothing left in her, no defensive spells at all. Just what was on the page.</p><p>The pony shape took the notebook. Tore the page from it. Crumpled it into a ball. Twilight's face stayed blank, but her mind watched in horror as her knowledge, all that precious knowledge, was crushed and mashed. The pony reached out a hoof, spreading her mouth open wide, and shoved the ball inside.</p><p>&quot;Chew.&quot;</p><p>She did, tears running down her face, expression still blank. She felt the paper crumple against her tongue, tearing between her teeth, and as it did the magic losing its structure, crumbling in her mouth. A decade of her life, struggle and pain and triumph, hard won, was all there, was all being destroyed. SHE was destroying it. She couldn't stop. She gave a ragged sob as she felt it melt away, Symbols dissolving, paper dissolving, magic dissolving, all collapsing to a soft gray pulp. No magic now. No expert knowledge. Just fiber and ink. </p><p>&quot;Swallow.&quot;</p><p>Her body obeyed before she could even try to struggle. One gulp, and even the pulp was gone. Nothing left. She felt empty. Weak and empty.</p><p>&quot;Follow.&quot;</p><p>The pony began to walk. She followed behind, limp and automatic.</p><p>The walk was long and vague, the surroundings always shifting in and out. But eventually, Twilight realized she was standing back at the desk, Haze's book still waiting, unopened. Some stones surrounded it, but the pony shape pushed them aside, off the table. It picked up the book, holding it in front of her. </p><p>&quot;Watch.&quot;</p><p>Slowly the cover began to open, pages fluttering, spreading. Twilight watched, unable to look away. As the book spread open, she thought she could see something on the clear white page-</p><p>A sharp, electric zap ran through her head. Twilight yelped, jumping back as the world rushed back into focus.</p><p>Hearing Twilight's cry and seeing her jolt backward, Haze set down the book and stepped forward, confused. The purple unicorn lay where she had fallen, limp against one of the shelves. He reached out a hoof, but before he could touch her, he heard a click above his head, and a dull pain suddenly shot down his horn. Grunting, he stumbled back, reaching toward the pain to feel a small metal ring tightly grasping the base of his horn. He could feel his magic pooling beneath it, blocked and useless now. He looked back to Twilight. She was gone.</p><p>He wheeled, scanning the room just in time to see a blur of purple shoot toward him. She hung in the air just long enough for him to see two things: the rage on her face, burning incandescent through the tears on her cheeks, and the two protective stones in front of her, held aloft in her magic. He reached out in defense, but there wasn't time. The stones dodged past his grasp, hitting his temples, hard as he tumbled back against one of the shelves. </p><p>There was a spark, and Haze screamed, seizing against the bookshelf as white-hot magical energy seared through every inch of him. For an instant, he thought he could smell something burning. Then he sank into darkness.</p><hr/><p><i>Someone was knocking at the door. </i></p><p>Twilight tightened the rope, and stepped back slightly. Haze's body hung spread eagle against the basement wall of the library, wrists and ankles tightly bound with rope that ran through metal eyelets above and below. She had installed them to easily hang tarps on the wall for various experiments, but now they were proving useful in other ways.</p><p><i>Someone was knocking at the door.</i></p><p>The ropes were just a start though, to hold him in position. Now she started on the magic. Thank Celestia, her spells had started coming back to her as soon as that jolt hit. Her mind still felt foggy, confused, but she could find what she needed, and she was going to use ALL of it. Restraints around the wrists, ankles, neck, far stronger than anything the ropes could do. Magic cancellation. Silence. More magic cancellation.  Layers of spells and counter spells, laid down over every inch of the unicorn. And sleep, to make sure he stayed like this for as long as needed. </p><p><i>Someone was knocking at the door.</i></p><p>The book was secured in a trunk at the far end of the basement, encased in so many spells that it would take a good fifteen minutes to get them all off again. Not that she was in any hurry to. Meanwhile, more spells for the unicorn-</p><p><i>Someone was knocking at the door.</i></p><p>With a frustrated yell she let the last spell drop. Rushing up the stairs from her basement and to the front door she yanked it open, and nearly off the hinges. Without seeing or caring who had been causing the noise, she started talking with a politeness so strained and intense it sounded as if it might crack into something homicidal at any moment. </p><p>&quot;I'm sorry but the library is closed right now,&quot; She strained through clenched teeth. &quot;We're having a little bit of an emergency, nothing to worry about, should be open again soon but for now I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Thanks!&quot; She slammed the door shut. </p><p>Right against a horseshoe the knocking pony had thrown in the jam. The door bounced back open. Twilight yelled again.</p><p>&quot;Look, will you PLEASE-&quot; For the first time, she finally saw the pony in front of her. He was tall and haggard, with eyes that seemed to see every part of her, accented by dark, tired circles. A beaten trench coat covered most of him, and in one of the far pockets Twilight thought she could see a flask. He looked young, older than Twilight, but young for what she was guessing his profession was, <br/>and even a little handsome, if handsome had tumbled down a hill and into a bar fight for a decade. He spoke.</p><p>&quot;That emergency wouldn't have a horn and a strange book would he?&quot;</p><p>Twilight's eyes widened. &quot;How did you-&quot;</p><p>Ignoring her question, the pony stepped past her, into the library. &quot;Twilight Sparkle, my name is Stormy Weather.&quot; He pulled what was indeed a flask from his coat, and took a long sip. &quot;We should talk.&quot;</p><hr/><p>The two ponies sat opposite each other at Twilight's kitchen table. Twilight poured some tea, offering a cup to Stormy. He shook his head, and began.</p><p>&quot;Thanks for sharing. Looks like you've got it contained, at least for the moment. Saves me some trouble.&quot; </p><p>Twilight sipped her tea. &quot;What do you know about all this? Who is he?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It. I know that much. The it that calls itself Haze. I've been chasing it for a long, long time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Calls itself?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh he started as a pony. Haze started as a pony. What's underneath our hooves now though, locked up in all that magic, isn't Haze. Not mostly anyway.&quot;</p><p>Stormy leaned back in his chair. &quot;Let me tell you a story Twilight Sparkle. Once, there was a village of ponies who could touch each other's minds. With a look, with a word, with a touch.&quot; He gave a grand gesture with his hoof. &quot;Normally that would be a recipe for disaster, for obvious reasons. But they found a balance in it somehow. Probably helped that it was temporary, only lasted a few <br/>minutes. Built their culture around it. Helped each other. They were isolated, lived near the base of a mountain without much contact with the rest of Equestria. Maybe on purpose. Seemed to work for them. For a while.&quot;</p><p>Twilight took a sip of the tea.</p><p>&quot;One of the unicorns from the village loved to explore the caves that burrowed into the mountain near the village. One day he found something. A book.&quot; Stormy pointed to the volume resting between them on the table. &quot;That book.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When he returned to the village, something was wrong with him. The other villagers tried to help.&quot; Stormy took a long sip from his flask. &quot;Things went bad. Very bad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All this started for me as a missing pony case. A few mares had gone missing here and there. The lucky ones showed up again with amnesia, or with empty eyes, empty heads and empty tongues. The unlucky ones just didn't show up again at all. All their friends and family told the same story: catching glimpses of a dusty brown unicorn around them before the disappearances.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I worked the cases back, further and further in time. Further than any kidnapping case should have gone, almost a century. Until I ended up at that village at the base of the mountain. I found the story I just shared in the village archives. The villagers weren't too talkative, but skeletons usually aren't. That was all there was, just bones and rotting buildings. They were having a good time though. No sleeping in graves for them. They were all over the town, hunched over tables, leaning against walls, tending empty stores, a whole bunch scattered across the main road.  Everyone in their place. Like the whole town decided to just stop moving one day, and nature took its course.&quot;</p><p>He leaned forward. &quot;I've been chasing him, IT, ever since. Got close a few times. Now I've finally caught up.&quot;</p><p>Twilight took a long gulp of the tea, letting the detective's story sink in. &quot;So you still don't know exactly what he, it is?&quot;</p><p>He shook his head. &quot;Only that its dangerous, on a level I haven't seen before. And you see a lot as a free-lance problem solver in Manehatten.&quot;</p><p>Twilight set down her cup. &quot;I'll get a letter to Princess Celestia as soon as my assistant returns. I'll need her help if I'm going to contain this, and she may know something we don't.&quot;</p><p>Stormy gave a nod. &quot;I'll defer to your expertise then. Chances are it'll take an alicorn to keep 'him' in check anyway. But whatever you're going to do, do it quick. Our guest has a way of slipping away, no matter how well he's secured.&quot;</p><p>Twilight nodded, standing. &quot;I'll start on the letter. If my assistant isn't back when it's finished, there are other ways I can-&quot;</p><p>She stopped suddenly, swaying slightly.</p><p>&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p>A wave of dizziness washed over the unicorn. She braced herself against the table, but the room kept tilting, swaying with a sickening lurch, back and forth. </p><p>&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p>Stormy's voice was soft and distorted. It sounded far, far away. Twilight's hooves felt a mile from her head, and her head felt so heavy. Like it might start...tumbling...down... She felt herself fall toward the table, but the rushing darkness swallowed her before her head hit the wood. Her limp body dragged the tea cup with it as she slid off the table, and unicorn and cup hit the floor together.</p><p>Stormy stood over her, expressionless. Bending down, he grasped her front hooves, and started to pull.</p><hr/><p>Twilight groaned. Her head throbbed. She tried to move a hoof to it, only to feel something holding it in place. A few short tugs proved the same was true of the other hoof, and her ankles. As the world slowly came into focus, she realized she was spread against the basement wall, with the same magic, ropes and, by the feel, the same horn ring she had been holding Haze in place with. </p><p>Haze was in front of her, sitting a few yards away in a wide cushioned chair pulled from storage deeper in the basement. He was lounging in it in utter relaxation, head back, legs spread. A pony sat at his feet, and as Twilight forced her aching head to focus she realized it was Stormy. His trench coat lay in a heap nearby, and stripped of it he looked smaller somehow, less imposing. His front hooves grasped the edge of the chair, holding himself steady as his head gently rose and fell between Haze's legs. From her position on the wall Twilight could only see the back of the detective's head, but the soft, wet sounds that rose from him occasionally made his actions clear enough. Haze's hoof rested on the back of his head, stroking his mane and giving an occasional shove of encouragement.</p><p>As she took all this in, Twilight saw Haze look up suddenly, catching her gaze. He grinned, his hoof giving a hard shove down and smiling a little wider as he heard the stallion between his legs start to choke. &quot;You'll have to forgive my friend-&quot; Haze said, forcing Stormy down farther with a rough thrust. &quot;He didn't know he was drugging you anymore than you did. He couldn't even have told that story without some help.&quot; He held up the detective's flask, dangling it from his hoof. The choking was growing quieter now. &quot;Pulls his mind together. Almost as good as new. There isn't much left of him otherwise.&quot; </p><p>Haze finally released his grip, and Stormy's head rushed up, involuntarily gasping for air, then sinking back down to continue its task. As soon as he did, Haze tipped the flask, pouring out the contents over Stormy's head. Twilight could smell the reek of alcohol across the room, but the detective gave no response as it soaked through his mane and ran down his face. Haze laughed, tossing away the empty flask and admiring Stormy's work for a moment. &quot;I wouldn't worry though. He has all the intelligence he needs.&quot; Haze stroked the obedient stallion, then got a good grip and forced him down again, setting his own quick rhythm with one, two, three thrusts and then holding him deep, deep down as he gave a pleased snarl. When the climax passed, Haze tugged Stormy up by the mane, pulling him off the object of his attentions with a quiet slurp and turning him to face twilight. He dangled limply from Haze's hoof, his eyes glassy, staring out into nothing. Cum pooled on his limp tongue, hanging from the tip, and more was splashed across his face and mouth.  &quot;Poor Stormy.&quot; Haze growled mockingly. &quot;He'll never know he found what he was looking for.&quot;</p><p>Twilight's eyes darted down for a moment, from the broken detective to what he had been tending too. Haze's thick length lounged between his legs, still slick and still hard. </p><p>With a flick, Haze tossed the detective to one side. He crumpled on to the floor in a broken heap, unseeing eyes staring up at the ceiling. The unicorn stepped toward Twilight, laughing as he saw her quick glance. &quot;Eager Twilight? Don't worry, there's plenty of time for that.&quot; She glared back at him, trying to say something, but discovering she couldn't. &quot;Shhh. No more talking Twilight.&quot;</p><p>He pulled out a book, bringing it to eye level. THE book. &quot;You have some reading to do.&quot;</p><p>Twilight forced her eyes shut as tight as they would go, tilting her head as far to the side as she could manage, away from the book. She heard a laugh, and felt Haze lean in beside her, whisper into her ear. The words he spoke were strange, foreign. They sounded soft and flowing, and as he spoke, they began to take on a hum. Not the words, so much as the ideas they were weaving. Even as Twilight couldn't understand what any of the ideas WERE, she could feel their presence, pulsing, glowing, vibrating in the air. Alive and growing stronger. In the air and in her, humming, twisting, breathing. Warm and alive and softly sinking into her mind. She tried to fight it, tried to struggle against the restraints, even though she knew better than any pony there was no possible way they would give. But there was no escape. Nowhere to go, no way to shut out the ideas, or even slow them, as they sunk deeper and deeper, spread further and further in her mind. No way to fight the gentle, slippery hum.</p><p>Slowly, she felt her body stop straining against the wall, every muscle slowly going limp in the restraints. There was no choice, no boundary to break. Control just slipped away. And even as she realized this, her mind followed. Heavier and warmer, duller and slicker. Until all the fight slid away, out into nothing. Every muscle loose, every thought limp. Every part of her warm, relaxed, obedient. The warmth pressed her eyes open. She saw the book, hovering in front of her, waiting. She smiled slightly. She was ready. </p><p>As she watched, it opened.</p><p>Lines danced on the page. Always shifting, re-arranging. At first they looked like a maze, and Twilight's obedient gaze traced a path through the churning passages, deeper and deeper to the center. But the further she delved, the larger the pattern grew. Focusing, she pressed further, deeper, and the maze kept twisting on, growing, spreading outward.</p><p>She suddenly realized the room was gone. Haze was gone. The pattern filled her field of view, flexing and turning in all directions. But she pressed forward, deeper, further. She had to find the center. The words had said so. The words still said so. She  worked deeper and deeper in, toward the center now of not a circle, but a sphere. Deeper and deeper, and things grew darker, even as the edges grew clearer and sharper. </p><p>Deeper and deeper, and the pleasant hum had become a howling now, like wind against sea cliffs, like wind racing down a mountain. </p><p>Deeper and deeper until all was pitch black, midnight black,  empty black. But in front of her, she could feel the center. Feel that she had arrived. She reached out a hoof. She was standing, now, the restraints gone, everything gone, just her and the center, the dark endpoint of the pattern. She reached out-</p><p>And touched it.</p><p>The howling stopped, dropping away into deathly silence. In the darkness she could see the pattern all around her, but not a maze now. Shapes weaving in and out, sharp, vicious thorny tendrils woven thick, not moving now, still. It was lighter now, just light enough to see the nest of tangled shapes around her, to see the slight hints of light outside. And to see something in front of her.</p><p>Tendrils rose from the floor, twisting and twitching angrily, weaving themselves together, weaving into something. Something that stepped toward her. Or seemed to. It looked like it had four legs, a head, maybe even something that could be a tail. Occasionally, when the writhing black lines formed just right, it almost resembled a pony. But then the lines would start to fight each other again, and the suggestion of a shape would collapse back into its vague mass. Whatever it was, it WAS stepping closer now. Right up to her. Looking down at her, a good foot taller than her.</p><p>Bending down. </p><p>Twilight couldn't move. She wanted to move, wanted to run, but she couldn't.  </p><p>Smiling. Or something that looked like a smile.</p><p>She couldn't move, she couldn't move.</p><p>Pressing closer.</p><p>Helpless, frozen. Helphelphelp- </p><p>And then Twilight felt the thing press against her. Against her lips. It was horribly cold, and sharp, like hundred knives all with the flats turned toward her and the terrifying implication that they might turn to their edges at any moment.</p><p>Terror flooded Twilight, icy cold. Can't move, can't escape. Can't move. </p><p>She felt a different cold start to spread through her. Not the coldness of fear, or winter. The coldness of death. The cold that was left when all the heat and vitality slipped away, never to return.  It started in her lips, then her face, her head. Then slowly down her back, her chest, her legs. Shivering, shaking, all the while the twisting, angry mass still pressed against her. Farther and farther, colder and colder until the last bit of warmth drained from her tail, and the thing pulled back. Smiled again.</p><p>All of Twilight's being was screaming. No sound could come now, but she was screaming, with every inch of her mind, her heart, her magic. The thing smiled wider, with that sharp, cold smile, black pits in its head staring down at her. And as Twilight looked into them, she realized the scream was the last thing she had. The last bit of warmth.</p><p>It started to waver, weaken. The thing kept smiling. Twilight could feel the scream slip inside her, pull, tumble- and it was gone. Inside the terrible thing, slight shimmers of purple could be seen, tangled in the thorny mass. It's sharp tendrils pushed at them, tugged, stabbed, crushed. Until at last it was finished.</p><p>Until at last the thing bent down again, kissing Twilight, letting the shimmering essence back into her. </p><p>Twilight blinked. </p><p>The terrible thing stared back. </p><p>Twilight screamed. </p><p>Really screamed now. Long and hard. Until there was no more air to scream with. Until her head spun, her legs gave out. And she collapsed, falling into darkness again.</p><hr/><p>Twilight felt wood under her. Her tongue was numb. For a moment, she stayed where she lay, letting the room around her fade in. Still the basement. She couldn't see Haze. Or Stormy. </p><p>Cautiously, she tilted her head slightly, eyes scanning the room. Finally she saw Haze, his back to her. Beyond him were the stairs. Twilight felt herself shiver, a bit of that horrible cold still lingering. She tried to focus, quickly weighing her options. Whatever was going on here, it was out of her power to control now, especially in her current state. The best she could hope for now was to disable Haze and get away, come back with help. She closed her eyes and waited.</p><p>Eventually she heard hoofsteps coming back to her. Closer, closer. When they were on top of her, she made her move. Rolling on to her back she gave a hard kick up. Right between Haze's rear legs.</p><p>She was rewarded with a satisfying yell from the unicorn as he collapsed onto the floor beside her. Springing to her hooves, Twilight hit him with the strongest confusing spell she could manage and bolted for the stairs. Ten yards, five, two-</p><p>Magic circled around her feet, drawing tight, and she tumbled to the the floor. Her mind raced as she tried to free her legs. Had the confusion spell not hit? Was she still too weak? Suddenly she realized something was wrong with the counterspells, the ones that should have freed her by now. </p><p>They weren't happening. At all. </p><p>Was the limiter ring still on? She couldn't move her hoofs, but she could roll her horn against the floor to see if- Her eyes went wide. Her horn was gone.</p><p>She felt herself plucked off the floor by the restraints, forced into a sitting position. Haze stepped out of the darkness, smiling. Twilight glared back. &quot;You took my magic.&quot;</p><p>He grinned. &quot;Not just took. Haven't you looked at the restraining spell Twilight?&quot;</p><p>She looked down. The glowing cuffs around her wrists and ankles were...purple. A very familiar shade.</p><p>&quot;Took and kept. I think I'll make better use of it. Let me show you-&quot;  </p><p>She saw the magic flash this time, unmistakably purple around his horn, then yelped as it hit, a painful jolt sparking between her legs.</p><p>He laughed, slowly circling her. &quot;Better already.&quot; Twilight followed him with her eyes, trying to stay calm. &quot;So what now?&quot;</p><p>He finished the circle, back in front of her. &quot;Now we finish you. And thanks to this-&quot; he held a hoof to the purple magic glowing on his horn &quot;There are so many possibilities.&quot; He closed his eyes a moment, thinking. Searching. Until he gave an awful laugh. &quot;Yes, this will work.&quot; </p><p>Worry spread over Twilight's face as he stepped closer. &quot;What are you-&quot; </p><p>&quot;You'll see.&quot;</p><p>Leaning forward, he held Twilight's head in his hooves, and started to cast. Twilight offered no immediate resistance, but as the spell started to sink into her her eyes went wide in recognition. &quot;No-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No what Twilight?&quot;</p><p>She only glared at him. The magic burrowing into her skull now was an interrogation spell, crafted at some point in Equestria's dark past. Abandoned by its creators because it was better at destruction than information gathering. The idea was to break down the victim's 'spirit', all the positive mental forces they could wield. Hope, willpower, love, confidence, identity. All the things that kept a mind going and held it together. If the mind was a safe, all the usual brainwashing and mind-altering spells tried to get at secrets by finessing out the combination, or drilling past the lock, or somehow coaxing it open. This spell didn't waste time. It just melted the safe completely, in the hopes that the caster could pull something useful from the steaming slag that was left. </p><p>Unfortunately, the spell only worked about half the time. Skill, mental strength and health were all unstable elements, and in the end there was often little left but mental wreckage. The spell had moved from interrogation to torture, and then been forgotten by all but the secret archives in Canterlot. Twilight had learned it defensively, so she could fight it if she had to. Even in training, it had been a hard spell to fight. Now, with no magic, she was helpless. A rabbit staring at a boulder tumbling down at it.</p><p>She shivered at the implications, involuntarily tugging at her restraints as the spell worked its way in. She kept glaring, but even as she did she knew it was pointless. There was no escaping this now, even if she could run. Her training had made her keenly aware of how the spell worked. Once it took hold, as it already had, it would keep on its task, deeper and deeper, until the caster called it off. She was already doomed, but was going to hold off admitting it for as long as she could.</p><p>Twilight winced as she felt the spell finally grip her mind and start to tighten. That was most of what it was designed to do, just grasp the outer shell, the mental defenses, and tighten, harder and harder, like a vice. Until things started to break.</p><p>As she twisted helplessly against the magic holding her in place, she felt the spell start to squeeze. Not physical like a headache, but mental, like all her thoughts, all her mental energy was being strained, pushed farther and farther. Harder and harder, tighter and tighter until something snapped. Some little piece collapsed against the strain. That DID hurt. A lot. Twilight yelped as the jab of pain hit her, followed by a brief, sickening wave of dread as the broken piece of her mind yielded what it had been defending.</p><p>&quot;Enjoying yourself Twilight?&quot; Haze mocked, adjusting the magic slightly.</p><p>She stayed silent, but there was no glaring now, just a look of dread. The bravado was gone. The feeling of that piece of her mind snapping, dissolving had shaken her. It had always been muted with her own magic as a defense, but now, full force, it was a sickening lurch. And that was just the first piece.</p><p>Another snapped. And another. Twilight jolted a little with each, fear and pain etching deeper and deeper on her face.</p><p>The spell kept tightening. Her mind kept collapsing, piece by piece, block by block. Her surroundings started to blur, sound and light still there, but less and less distinct. She realized there were tears running down her cheeks. She couldn't remember when that had started.</p><p>She tried to focus, tried to hold together. But it was so strong, so painful and every collapse made the dread stronger, made her feel more and more disoriented and overwhelmed.</p><p>She was quietly sobbing now. Shaking. Her head was burning. It was so hard to think, so hard to think. </p><p>She felt something shift. Accelerate. Oh Celestia, it was speeding up. Her eyes widened. This had always been the point the training had stopped at, the point of no return. She knew what was coming next.</p><p>&quot;Please, please no. Don't...&quot;</p><p>The pleading wasn't for Haze. She wasn't even aware he was there anymore. It was just a plea for help. A plea to make the pain stop.</p><p>The spell crushed tighter. Twilight gave a terrified gasp. That was all it had needed. With that last press, the snapping, grinding collapse of her mind snowballed, until it fell into a constant cascade of destruction.</p><p>Twilight screamed, thrashing in the restraints like a wild animal. A torrent of destruction poured through her, memories flashing and vanishing in an instant, a pony with a stetson, an alicorn teaching magic, a levitating egg, stacks of books, pancakes, her first crush, her first book, her first letter. All gone. All ground up and thrown away.</p><p>Her vision glowed purple. She shook like a current was going through her, her screams vibrating with her body. She couldn't feel the collapse any more, just the raw pain and fear. More than she had ever known was possible. More than she had ever thought she could survive.</p><p>And then it stopped. </p><p>Her body collapsed, free from the restraints, to sprawl on the floor. Twitching slightly. Gasping for air as if she had been drowning. Sobbing, but in relief now. And gasping something between the sobs, slurred and mangled.</p><p>&quot;anythingatall&quot;</p><p>Haze leaned over the crumpled pony &quot;What was that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Anything at all, do anything at all, no more, won't fight, good pony, will do anything at all, no more-&quot;</p><p>Haze smiled. &quot;Good.&quot; And stood. &quot;But I'm not done yet.&quot;</p><p>Twilight's eyes went wide.</p><p>&quot;Nononononnooooo!&quot;</p><p>The spell tightened around her mind again.</p><hr/><p>Everything hurt. Everything hurt so bad. </p><p>There was a hoof stroking. Stroking over her mane. That felt nice. She smiled. </p><p>Slowly her eyes drifted open. She was looking up. A dusty brown unicorn was sitting behind her, looking down at her. Her head was in <br/>his lap. It felt nice.</p><p>&quot;Hello.&quot; He said, smiling.</p><p>&quot;Hello.&quot; She replied softly, smiling back. She gazed up at him a moment. &quot;Your hoof feels nice.&quot;</p><p>He smiled. &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p><p>She shifted up, a little farther into his lap. &quot;What's your name?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Haze.&quot; He said, still stroking. &quot;What's yours?&quot;</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at this, thinking. &quot;I...I don't know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, where are you from?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I...can't remember?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Friends? Family?&quot;</p><p>She shook her head. &quot;I can't-&quot;</p><p>He grasped her head, gently tilting her gaze back up to him. &quot;Would you like to?&quot;</p><p>She paused a moment, then nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Good.&quot; He pulled her up a little further, until she was sitting in his lap, leaning back against him. &quot;You need to do exactly as I <br/>say though, or it won't work. Understand?&quot; She nodded.</p><p>&quot;Good.&quot; He gave her flank a gentle stroke. &quot;Spread your legs.&quot;</p><p>She did, spreading her legs until they rested against his. She felt herself blush, but wasn't sure why.</p><p>&quot;Well done.&quot; His hoof traced down her belly, sliding between her legs to stroke at her sex. </p><p>&quot;Wha-what are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's part of the process. You said my hoof felt good, didn't you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot; She murmured.</p><p>&quot;Does it still feel good?&quot; He gave a teasing twist.</p><p>&quot;Yes!&quot; She gasped. </p><p>&quot;Then relax. Relax, and listen. You won't be able to understand at first, but don't worry. You will<br/>in time.&quot;</p><p>As his hoof continued its work, he lowered his mouth to her ear, and began to speak. Just as he said, the words made no sense to her, they seemed jumbled and confused. But his hoof did feel good. Soothing. She relaxed against him. Relaxed and listened. And drifted...</p><hr/><p>&quot;Hey.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey!&quot;</p><p>She blinked. She had lost track of time somehow. The unicorn wasn't speaking the strange words anymore.</p><p>&quot;You stopped?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Almost done.&quot; He replied. She realized her head felt strange. Full, somehow. And her body felt warm. Flushed.</p><p>&quot;Are you ready to remember?&quot; He asked. She nodded. &quot;Good. Hold on.&quot; </p><p>She was about to ask why when his hoof started to move between her legs again, firm and very, very quick, back and forth against her. She gasped, moaned as a wonderful wave of pleasure washed over her, then another happy moan of gratitude as it receded. She looked up to thank the unicorn, but before she could she felt something turning in her mind, thoughts swirling, coming together, slipping into place until the whole thing settled, setting like concrete into one solid whole.</p><p>She blinked. </p><p>She remembered.</p><p>She blushed, hurriedly pulling herself from the unicorn's lap and pressing herself to the floor, head against his hoof.</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't know, I didn't, I'm sorry-&quot;</p><p>The unicorn tilted her head up to face him, smiling.</p><p>&quot;It's OK. You didn't know. But now you do. Don't you?&quot; She nodded.</p><p>&quot;Good. Stand.&quot;</p><p>Shakily she rose, and as she did he did as well, stepping back to sit in a wide, cushioned chair behind him. He tapped the floor in front of the chair. </p><p>&quot;Sit.&quot; She did, stepping up the chair and sitting at his feet. &quot;Now, tell me what you remember. Where are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The basement of the Golden Oak Library in Ponyville.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What is your name?&quot;</p><p>&quot;s-Scrap. Scrap Paper.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why is that your name, and your mark?&quot;</p><p>She glanced down to her flank, and a cutie mark of three simple blank pages greeting her gaze. &quot;Because I'm useful, but disposable.&quot;</p><p>He nodded. &quot;What are you Scrap?&quot;</p><p>&quot;A slave.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And what am I?&quot;</p><p>&quot;My owner and Master.&quot; She gave a slight bow with her head as she said this.</p><p>&quot;And why are you my slave, Scrap?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because it's the proper place for me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And why is that?&quot;</p><p>She blushed a little. &quot;Because my nature is to serve, please, and obey.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And how do you know that that's true?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because I love to be of service. More than anything in the world.&quot;</p><p>He laughed, spreading his legs to show her his length, full and waiting. He gestured her forward with his hoof.</p><p>&quot;Show me. Come and serve slave.&quot;</p><p>Smiling gratefully, she nodded, leaning forward. She reached out, tenderly grasping his length in her hooves, shivering at its warmth. Slowly, she started to stroke, both hooves together up and down the sides, smiling as the deep black cock grew even stiffer under her touch. She smiled up at him, keeping his gaze as she lower her head to nuzzle teasingly at the underside as the hooves worked, stroking, teasing. This close, she could smell him, deep and musky, and it was suddenly harder to keep up the slow, teasing pace.</p><p>At the first bead of precum she started to lick, using her hooves to pull the cock down a little, angling it toward her tongue so she could lap and curl over the hot skin, first the head, then gradually down the whole underside in long, slow drags until finally she was lapping at his balls. She moaned happily as his taste hit her tongue, salty and slick, stroking and licking deeper, teasing more pre from him. </p><p>She felt her Master's hoof on her mane, and looked up, lips still pressed against his balls. </p><p>&quot;How does it feel to serve again slave?&quot;</p><p>Not breaking her gaze for a moment, she shifted her posture slightly as she sat, spreading her legs so her Master could see her sex, slick with arousal and dripping onto the floor.</p><p>&quot;Better than anything in the world.&quot; She replied with utter sincerity. He laughed. &quot;Then finish your work.&quot;</p><p>She nodded. Her head rose, lips pressing against his tip, then slipping over it, over and slowly down, her head sinking into his lap. She came back up and started a rhythm, quick and eager, steady bobs up and down, up and down, with a hungry look up at him every so often.</p><p>He was starting to groan now, louder as she worked faster and faster in his lap, hooves teasing the base as her mouth worked the rest. A little deeper, a little faster. She could feel him against the back of her throat, feel the pre running thick, feel him start to twitch against her tongue.</p><p>And then he was over, cumming with a satisfied groan. She moaned happily as his spunk rushed into her mouth, hit the back of her throat, rolled down her tongue, hot and salty. She swallowed every drop, still rising and falling in his lap until he was spent, then gently licking him clean as his length retreated back into his lap.</p><p>When he was finally clean, she shuffled back slightly, pressing her head to the floor, flank held high behind her. Reverently, she pressed her lips to his hoof, kissing, then licking.</p><p>&quot;Service is joy.&quot;</p><p>Then the other hoof, a kiss and a lick.</p><p>&quot;Service is peace.&quot;</p><p>Closing her eyes, she rested her head against his hoof, gently nuzzling like an affectionate dog to its owner.</p><p>&quot;I will serve my master with joy, and be at peace&quot;</p><p>His hoof pressed against her mane, gently stroking. It felt fantastic.</p><p>&quot;Welcome back slave.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you Master.&quot; She replied, voice cracking with gratitude. &quot;Thank you so much.&quot;</p><hr/><p>They were at the desk again. Scrap was bent over it, front hooves grasping the far edge, tail raised over her back, legs spread wide. She felt him press up against her, his length hot against her ass, and shivered in anticipation. She felt him lean over her, front hooves next to hers. Length stroking, grinding, teasing. She rolled her hips, quietly begging. He made her beg louder, and she obeyed, smiling as she pleaded for his cock with the most obscene words she could manage. He kept teasing, grinding, stroking until she was moaning and twisting under him, clawing at the desk with need. </p><p>And then he took her.</p><p>His head pressed inside her. She gave a happy moan as he finally entered and slowly sunk into her, thick and hot and wonderful. Teasing every inch, deeper and deeper until he was all the way in. Scrap groaned as she felt his balls against her sex, loving the realization that every inch of him was buried in her now almost as much as the feeling of it. He held there for a moment, just his breath and hers, both ragged, eager.</p><p>Scrap heard a quiet thump in front of her on the table and looked up to see an old, thick book. She didn't recognize it. He spread it as she watched, flicking through the pages, but from this angle, head to the table, all she could see was the edge. But it didn't matter. She only had a moment to ponder the book before she felt him pull back and begin to thrust. </p><p>Scrap gave a deep, feral groan. There was no gentleness to his motions, the movement of her Master's hips was hard, deep and savage. And that was EXACTLY what she wanted. What she needed. She was ready for it, Her &quot;readiness&quot; was dripping down the edge of the table and pooling on the floor, and she needed it so, so badly. There was no resistance, no pain. Just the rough, raw satisfaction of being <br/>pounded like an animal in rut. </p><p>Slowly, she felt magic twist its way through her. Her magic, or what had been hers. Up through her body and out to the book. But there was no change she could feel, other than that everything she was feeling felt even better, even more vivid. She groaned under him, tongue hanging from her mouth as she started to feel a little overwhelmed by the pleasure. He pulled her back as he took her, <br/>shifting the angle and for just a moment she could see the strange book, could see something on the page. It looked like some kind of maze, with Ponyville in the middle. Before she could think about it much, her Master pressed her head back to the table and it was out of view again, forgotten amidst the pleasure of her Master's cock.</p><p>She moaned and gasped as he pressed her into the table, faster now, harder. So happy. So content. This was purpose, this was meaning, this was fantastic! At last the pleasure pushed her over the edge and she came, grabbing the table for dear life, every muscle tight, then suddenly loose. Gasping, panting. Slowly coming down. She looked back at her Master. </p><p>&quot;T-thank you m-&quot; He gave another thrust, and came himself. And as the thick, hot liquid filled her Scrap froze mid-sentence, another orgasm rolling through her at the wonderful, unexpected warmth. And then another, and another, and another...</p><p>When he finally pulled out, Scrap was long past saying anything. She could only groan in exhausted pleasure. She shuddered a moment, and then her legs gave out and she slid off the table, collapsing onto the floor. Her face looked like she had found all of the most &quot;special&quot; plants in the Everfree and eaten them all at once; tongue lolling over a stupid smile, eyes distant and happy. Everything felt utterly amazing. Her muscles were all limp now; the most she could do was lay where she fell and give a pathetic, bleating moan of contentment.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye Scrap could see Haze lift a quill to the book, writing something. She thought, for a moment, that she should be interested in this for some reason. She laughed at this, or tried to. What would a slave need with magic? She had all the &quot;magic&quot; she needed in her three holes and her teasing hooves. Anything else was best left to others. Her place was to lay here in the afterglow, feeling her Master's warm, wonderful seed inside her, slowly running down her thighs, and know that she was useful. Nothing could be better than this. Nothing could be better than serving her purpose. Nothing could be better than serving Him. </p><p>She rubbed her legs together, giving a soft sigh as she felt his warmth between them. She was so happy to be here. She hoped she could serve for a long, long time.</p>

<p>The rain was coming down hard in Ponyville.</p><p>The wind blew the drops almost horizontal, driving through cold, biting air to crash against the Golden Oak library. But inside, away from the cold and the wind, they were only a soft thumping against the wood and glass of the second-story window, a smooth, soothing rhythm in the morning dark. </p><p>Beneath the window, a unicorn lay on a small, round cushion, murmuring happily at the sound of the rain. She shifted, still half-asleep, stretching lazily and enjoying the sound as long as she could. It felt comforting, reassuring. As if everything was where it should be. Everything in its place. </p><p>With one last long stretch, Scrap rose from her bed, sleepily making her way down the stairs to the first floor. The Golden Oak was emptier now. No tables or desks in the wide open center of the space. No books in the empty shelves. She missed those a little still. They had looked so nice on the shelves, and when she opened some there had been beautiful pictures and letters in lovely, swirling strokes of ink. She had even managed to read a few pages in some. </p><p>But she could never get farther than that. Somewhere around the third or fourth page the ideas from the books would always start to get vague and confused, mixed around with each other. And then she'd have to lie down for a while before she could think right again. So she'd given them away, bit by bit, to ponies who wanted them. At least they had good homes now.</p><p>And there was one wall of shelves that was still useful. A large board had been nailed up over it, and hooks hung from it here and there, each with its own label and outline. Under each label and in each outline her work gear hung. A row of collars in a variety of widths and colors arched over a selection of riding crops, and both were flanked by bridles on one side and bits on the other, with a row of  hoof cuffs beneath. She smiled as she looked over the selection. Everything neat and easy to find. Everything in its place. </p><p>Humming softly to herself, Scrap reached out, pulling a collar from beneath a label that read  &quot;Blak Collur - Thik.&quot;  She fastened it in place with practiced ease, sighing at the feel of the leather, then reached for the next items. A deep black tail wrap wound neatly around the base of her tail. </p><p>She worked a brush carefully through her mane and tail until they fell neatly into place, then found a sponge, letting it soak, wringing it out, and then gently scrubbing at her flank. Slowly, the sponge went black, pulling the scattered remains of paint from her side.  Still humming, she toweled the flank dry, then pressed a small stencil to it, painting fresh words in with thick block letters:</p><p>SERVICE MARE <br/>FREE TO USE</p><p>She did the same on the other flank, then set the stencil carefully back on its hooks. Turning in front of the long mirror nearby, she gave herself one last check, smiling at what she saw. Bit, collar, tail wrap, paint. Check. Everything in its place. <br/>With a nod to the mare in the mirror, she crossed the bare interior of the Golden Oak, heading for the door. As it opened she saw the rain had stopped. Time to go. Time to be of service. With a rush of eager anticipation, the purple pony stepped out into a new day.</p><hr/><p>The stallion plodded a straight line through the muddy road, ignoring the muck splattered up the lower half of his legs. He looked up to see what had once been Sweet Apple Acres, freshly fallen rain dripping from the gate. The wooden sign had been replaced, and now the empty space cut into it depicted a crudely carved earth pony sprawled seductively over an enormous apple. The logo was repeated again in glowing green neon across the front of the barn, along with the business's new name: &quot;The Candied Apple.&quot; The barn itself had grown and spread considerably over the land it sat on, until its size now looked almost triple what it had been.</p><p>A massive earth pony at the door waved the stallion through as he approached. He entered. Inside loud, pulsating music rolled through the club, hit him like a wave, underlined by the lingering stench of spilled alcohol and cigarettes. Every vertical surface was covered in cheap imitation wood painted black. Every horizontal one but the floor was black acrylic. Every edge was rimmed with some kind of neon. On a wide island in the center three earth ponies were sliding and twisting around poles, bending at just the right angle to give the crowd seated around them a good show. </p><p>Waitresses in flimsy costume stetsons roamed through the sea of tables, keeping the drinks flowing. A few were bent over tables with a customer on top, or kneeling, faced pressed between their customer's thighs.</p><p>The stallion pushed through to the far end of the room. Along the center of the wall were two wide swinging doors with the outline of a barn painted crudely around them and above that, in white paint that glowed in the club's blacklight: </p><p>&quot;The Stable&quot;</p><p>The stallion blinked as he stepped through the doors. The bright light of the wide corridor here was a harsh change from the dim glow of the club. The corridor was constructed in a rough approximation of a stable, but impossibly clean and cheap. The floors were more of the fake wood texture, as were the walls on either side, which went too high to let anypony see into the stalls indicated at regular intervals by wide sliding doors and small plastic signs. The music of the club was a distant throbbing now, replaced only by an eerie silence highlighted by the buzzing of the florescent overhead. </p><p>The stallion ignored the first stalls, heading deep into the corridor, passing door after door until he was nearly at the back. At the last door on the right he stopped, turned. The sign for the stall featured a crude cartoon depiction of a familiar earth pony, stupidly smiling mouth splayed open to let a speech bubble emerge.</p><p>&quot;Howdy! I'm Applejack! I used to run this place back before I realized my true calling. Now it's under new management, and so am I! I'm a sturdy little mare, so don't be afraid to be rough. I can't wait to take your cock!&quot;</p><p>He reached for the door, pulling. It slide easily to the side along its track. As he entered, it slid closed behind him. The room was small, only a little larger than a long, rectangular closet. It was dimmer than the hallway, only one weak, bare bulb above.</p><p>An earth pony was curled up in the shadows at the far end. She turned as he entered, the painted &quot;silver&quot; pieces on her hackamore glinting. She looked worn down, every part of her tired, heavy.  As Applejack's eyes met his, her mouth twisted to an angry snarl, but the weariness in her eyes made it clear it was a toothless threat. There was still strength in the mare, but it was struggling to stay there.</p><p>The stallion stepped into the shadows, toward the mare. He reached out, untying her reigns from the iron ring set in the wall and giving them a firm tug. The mare rose. He stepped out into the corridor. She followed. </p><p>He led her back up, then around a corner, to another door. It opened onto a wide rectangular room, dirt floor replacing wood. There was a single hay bale at the center, and he walked them to it and sat. He took a small cloth bag out, setting in beside him. He reached into it, hoof shuffling inside the fabric, and returning with a single sugar cube. He held it out.  </p><p>The moment it was out the earth pony's eyes were fixed on the cube, staring for several seconds, then falling to the floor, her expression sinking to sad resignation. Obediently, she sat in front of the stallion, at his feet. Her eyes drifted back up to the cube, hanging just above and in front of her. His hoof gave a slight upward tug.</p><p>&quot;Beg.&quot;</p><p>Her eyes closed in one last flicker of regret, but her body was already moving. By the time they opened she was in the expected position: head up, mouth open, tongue out, front hooves raised like a dog. Like a good dog. The stallion let the cube drop on to her tongue. She pulled it in in an instant, swallowed, shuddered, eyes drifting closed. Her body relaxed slightly as she sighed. When  her eyes opened their were calmer, less resistive.</p><p>He held out another cube. </p><p>&quot;Canter.&quot;</p><p>She rose, starting off for the far side of the room. There were two thin metal support beams placed along the center line of the room, and she started to weave between them, winding back and forth in a figure-eight already well-worn in the dirt beneath her. The stallion shuffled, getting comfortable on the hay as he watched her. For all the wear and tear, the earth pony was still quite a sight. Strong, trained muscle rising and falling, hooves catching the ground, twisting back, pulling forward again, tapping the soft ground in a gentle, rolling beat.</p><p>&quot;Stop.&quot;</p><p>She stopped, coming to a halt in front of the bale. The stallion held out another cube, letting her eat it from his hoof this time, then a second, then a third. She accepted them with a contented sigh, lingering a little on his hoof after the third. She looked at him, but the stallion only smiled.</p><p>&quot;Buck.&quot;</p><p>She headed for the far wall. Four heavy punching bags waited there, set into alcoves, wide as tree trunks and almost as high. Sturdy metal poles ran down the center of the bags and into grooves in the floor. Applejack grasped the handle of the first bag in her teeth, straining as she pulled the heavy bag out into the room. Her body shifted and bent as she worked the bag out to the end of the groove, and as she shifted positions the stallion saw her sex flash a moment behind her swinging tail, lingering just long enough to see slick and wet sparkle off the dark flesh. The bag finally found the end of its groove with a dull click, and Applejack returned to the wall, starting in on the second. </p><p>When all the bags were in place, they surrounded Applejack, staggered and spread like a small grove of trees without their tops. The earth pony walked to the nearest, turned. And bucked. Head down, front legs bracing, back legs coming up fast, hard, hitting the bag so hard it tipped slightly despite the pole inside. The stallion flinched a little at the deep smack of hoof on vinyl echoing through the room. The little mare had a lot of power stored up in her.  The hooves struck out again, over and over, hard, heavy hits. And then she let them drop, left the first “tree” still shaking and moved to the second with one smooth, swinging pivot. SMACK again. Powerful flanks giving their target everything they had, again and again, her whole body coiling and releasing in perfect form. Swing, pivot. SMACK!  </p><p>As he watched the mare buck, the stallion reached between his legs. The cock that met his hoof was already nearly full, and it soon gained the rest of its enthusiasm as he casually stroked, eyes following the mare's every twist. </p><p>Gradually, he saw her start to slow. Her breath was coming harder now, sweat glistening off her coat. As he watched, her kicks started to soften. The graceful pivots from one target to another hesitated, stumbled. Soon she was panting, sweat dripping from her as she twisted, coiled, lashed out, every kick seeming more and more confused, uneven. Off balance. Father and farther off the mark, until one kick missed entirely. Her legs rushed past the bag, swishing through empty air, and the unstopped momentum carried the rest of her body out, out and up and then down again, to land with a hard thud in the dirt.</p><p>As she began to pick herself up, the stallion gave a whistle. She tried to rise,  collapsed. Tried again, struggling to her feet and slowly stumbled back to the stallion, tumbling down to sit at his feet. She looked up, and he saw her expression had changed dramatically. The panting mare had a limp, dazed smile now, her eyes dull and distant. The resentful, resistive pony was gone completely: this was a mare ready and eager for whatever might be asked of her.</p><p>The stallion spread his legs, giving Applejack a good view of the cock that had enjoyed her performance so much, heavy and full. He rested a hoof on the wide balls beneath, pointing.</p><p>&quot;Lick.&quot;</p><p>Applejack collapsed into his lap with a sloppy smile, moaning as she clumsily ground her nose against the warm orbs. Her tongue flicked out, lapping eagerly at the air, then slowly adjusting down until it found his warm, leathery flesh. As she licked the stallion shifted slightly, and his heaving length drooped, flopping down to rest against her forehead. She grinned as the warm flesh pressed against her, happily nuzzling into it as she kept licking. The stallion smiled, relaxing in his seat and enjoying every careful twist of the apple mare's eager tongue. </p><p>After a while, he grasped Applejack's hair, pulling her up away from his balls, eye to eye with him. The earth pony gazed back, mouth drooping in a limp smile, eyes dull. His hoof played with her mouth, gently pulling her tongue out, placing another cube on it, and pressing it back in her mouth, closing her lips around it. She giggled, swallowing.  He fed her another. And another. She was swaying a little now. He pulled her mouth open again. The earth pony's laugh turned to a small,  confused grunt as she felt much more than expected shoved into her mouth. It took just a moment for the mare to realize that half the stallion's sugary treats were now in her mouth. </p><p>Her eyes went wide, panicking, struggling desperately to break away, to get the cubes out. But her strength and coordination were long gone, and all strong, able farm mare could do now was flop pathetically in the stallion's hooves.  But all the strength in the world wouldn't have mattered anyway. It was too late now. It had been too late in the few moments it had taken her to realize what he had stuffed in her mouth. She shook her head, refused to swallow, but it didn't matter. The sugar had melted, and its payload was already seeping into her.</p><p>Her head was still struggling in his grasp when it hit. She froze, eyes so wide. Her pupils shuddered, drowning in a sea of white, then rolling up into her skull. She moaned against his hoof, low and delirious, and as he let go her mouth splaying open into to a wide, broken grin, tongue flopping out as everything in the mare's mind collapsed in a flood of hot, happy mush. She hung in space a moment,  shuddering. And then she was limp, slipping from the stallion's hooves to sprawl on the floor.</p><p>She hit the ground heavy and lay where she fell, twitching weakly against the dirt. Occasionally a moan shuddered out of her. The moans grew louder and her hooves stirred, clawing aimlessly at the ground, at the air, trying to find some solid point of reference, drooling as the pleasure burned through her brain. Slowly, the moans grew quieter, the clawing slower, until she went still, only occasionally twitching.</p><p>The stallion rested a hoof against her flank, giving a gentle shove. The mare gave a long, needy moan, hooves giving a few pathetic kicks. Smiling, the stallion rose. Bending down, he grasped the limp pony by her forelegs and dragged her up, over the bale then gave a hard toss forward. Applejack slumped into place, laid out over the bale on her belly, legs drooping from one end, her head from the other.  </p><p>Walking to the tail end of the apple pony, the stallion reached out, running a hoof over her flank. She gave another quiet, aching moan. He pulled back the hoof, bringing it down with a hard slap this time. Applejack's head came up, squealing in agonized need. She twisted uselessly on the bale, wide tail swinging against her client. His hoof found her flank again, gently running down the sore muscle, down and back, grasping, pulling. Spreading her.  Her sex glistened, dripping as it parted, and he could see the mare's thighs were soaked.  Holding her spread, he reached in with his other hoof, gently running up and down the mare's dark pussy. Applejack shuddered in response, letting a babbling, exhausted moan tumble from her mouth.</p><p>His hooves left her flank, working their way up the bale. He leaned over her, braced comfortably in the hay, and pressed his hips forward, grinding his wide tip against her slick, hot lips. Applejack ground back, head twisting, groaning with delirious gratitude, rolling her rear against him. Begging.</p><p>With a tilt of the hips and a push, the stallion finally gave the mare her wish. His cock sunk into her without the slightest resistance, her slick, well-used sex taking every inch in one smooth, firm thrust. Applejack gasped under him, choking, struggling for air. as the rush of sensation burned through her drug-soaked mind. Before she could recover he was taking her, hard and steady, his wide tip spreading her eagerly, grinding her into the hay. She squealed, flailing limply under him as she finally found her breath, front hooves digging into the bale with a death grip. Her voice slowly sank into regular, animalistic grunts, coming in time with his thrusts as she rode the wave of pleasure, tongue swinging from her mouth as she took what he gave her, twisting and grinding  She urged him on, bucking her ass up into him with rabidly focused force. Enough to be dangerous, if the drug hadn't weakened her.  Bucking, grinding, panting, sweating, yelping. Harder, harder, harder!</p><p>Until finally the stallion groaned above her, pulsed inside her, gasping in satisfaction. His warm spunk rushed into her, filled her. Applejack tensed, every muscle straining as she gave a low, gurgling groan, mind and body on the verge of collapse as she hit the climax of a climax. Another groan, another squeeze of flank and pussy. And another, each a little weaker. And another. And then, shuddering, the mare went limp against the hay,, her groan melting to a soft, whimpering babble as the last coherent parts of her mind crumbled, dissolving like sugar on a hot tongue. </p><p>The stallion pulled out of the twitching mare with a contented sigh. She gave no response as he grasped her tail, tugging it forward to wipe his softening cock. He gave her one last slap, tossing his bits next to her on the hay. She kept up her soft stream of babble, barely audible now, as the spunk ran from her sex, dripping to pool in the dirt.</p><p>The stallion turned, heading for the door. As he neared it, he reached into his sugar cube bag, pulling out a handful of the treats and shoving them in his mouth, casually chewing. He smiled as he stepped out into the corridor. Money well spent.  </p><hr/><p>Silver Lining sighed, crumpling up another paper in his magic and tossing it aside. The unicorn pulled another book from the large stacks that surrounded him, flipping quickly to a bookmarked page, then back a bit, forward. His eyes flickered back and forth between the book and the spell carefully spread out on the large paper under his hooves. It was almost complete now, but it still refused to work. Something kept failing at the last moment. He could feel he was close now, but  the words on the page were starting to blur together, and he kept catching himself re-reading the same sentence. With a frustrated grunt the young silver unicorn rose from the table, heading out the door.  He needed a distraction. Maybe a snack would help him think.</p><p>The bell over the door rang cheerfully as Silver stepped inside Sugar Cube Corner. But as he took a step forward the cheerful jingle was quickly drowned out by another sound: the wet, eager thudding of enthusiastic sex. A few feet from the door a bright pink pony was on her back across a table, back hooves high in the air, spread wide for the stallion between them. The mare's head hung over the opposite end of the table, facing Silver, and as she saw him enter she gave a bright, friendly upside down smile. </p><p>&quot;Hey there! Welcome to Sugar Cube Corner! I'm Pinkie Pie, Sugarcube's complementary cocktoy! As a valued customer, I'm yours to enjoy however ya like (With any purchase of five bits or greater).&quot;</p><p>Silver blinked, suddenly off balance both by how attractive the mare looked and how utterly unphased she seemed to be from the fucking she was getting. &quot;I uh, I haven't ordered yet-&quot;</p><p>Pinkie giggled &quot;Of course not silly, you can't order before you come in and you can't come in before you order. Just come back around again once you're ready.&quot; She gave him a playful wink. </p><p>Giving the enthusiastic pony a hesitant nod, he headed for the counter, ordering a few cupcakes. These in hoof, he found an empty table, sitting and starting to nibble through his purchase. As he ate he brought the spell back up in his mind, shuffling the parts, trying to see what was missing. </p><p>A loud slurp from across the room broke his concentration. The pink pony had finished with the customer on the table, and was sitting on the ground between two others now, large earth ponies with cocks to match. There was barely space for her head between the two long shafts as it bounced between them, licking and slurping along their length, hooves eagerly stroking at both. And all the while, cheerfully yammering.</p><p>&quot;-ponies and that's why you're great! Really gives a hoof full! Or a mouthful! Or a hairful! That can be hard sometimes though wh-mmmgh  yuugh iich haaa mmmhgg nggh hllk mmmyuh- and that's no good unless you-sshllk mmghngh muugh-&quot; Even a mouth full of cock, the pink pony's commentary didn't stop for a moment. It was clear from their expressions that the stallions were starting lose patience. Finally one grabbed a spoon from the table and, as Pinkie came up for air again, gave her nose a soft tap with it.</p><p>&quot;But I said-&quot; And then the mare was silent, mouth still moving, but with no voice to back it up. In a moment she noticed the sudden muteness and looked up to the stallion with a pouting expression. He only gestured back to his cock with the spoon, and the pink mare resumed her task with a hint of resentment which was quick to slip away. </p><p>Before long the stallions finished. The first came in her mouth, the second across her face and hair in thick, heavy strands. As they pulled back, she held her mouth open for them, smiling as she rolled the spunk on her tongue, savoring. Swirling around and around and around until she finally swallowed, smiling lips opening again to show an empty mouth. Silver blinked, suddenly realizing his erection was pressing against the underside of the table.  </p><p>He shuffled awkwardly in his seat, trying to get more comfortable. When he looked back Pinkie had climbed onto another customer, her wide, soft ass pressed eagerly against his lap. She still hadn't gotten her voice back, but her body was clear enough. She ground her rear into the smiling stallion she was riding in a rolling motion, slow and teasing, looking back at him over her shoulder with with a wink and a gaze that said &quot;Fuck me until your dick melts big boy.&quot; More or less.</p><p>Under her care, it didn't take long for the stallion beneath her to melt into a moaning, panting mess, gasping with need as he thrust against her.  She teased, pulling him along quickly, then slowing a moment, then quick again. Until finally, with a deep groan, he was finished too. As Pinkie rose, spunk dripping from between her legs, the stallion she left looked half-dead, hanging limp in the chair. But dazed smile spread wide on his face made it clear he was very, very satisfied with the service he had received. Silver watched in rapt interest, idly stroking himself beneath the table as Pinkie moved to the next customer calling for her.</p><p>This one tossed her on a table again, belly down this time. Pinkie laughed playfully, giving a very pleased moan as he grabbed her legs and pressed into her. The customer must have been having a rough day, because once he was in there was no warmup. The pink party pony got it hard and fast, the table shaking under them as he slammed into her. But Sugar Cube's cumdump  couldn't have been happier.. She groaned in satisfaction as he took her, tongue hanging from a wide grin, urging him on. </p><p>Another customer approached from the opposite end of the table, and she smiled &quot;Oh hey! Welcome to Sugar C-Glllgkk!&quot; Uninterested her her greeting, the second stallion unceremoniously sunk himself into her mouth and started to thrust, hard and fast. Pinkie gagged at the sudden force-fed stallion meat, but she adapted with surprising speed, and in moments she was taking it like a pro, eyes only watering slightly as the wide flare ground against her throat.</p><p>The stallions grew even rougher, each feeding off the other's eagerness. Pinkie squirmed and twisted between them, choking and moaning helplessly. Just as the table looked like it might collapse from the hard fucking on top of it, the stallions reached their peak, giving an angry, growling groan as they filled the mare beneath them. Pinkie gave a low, wavering sound of grateful satisfaction, taking everything they could give. When they were finally drained, the two stallions left, stumbling away contentedly. Pinkie lay where they left her, spunk dripping from mouth and sex, hanging limply from the table. Silver suddenly realized he had left his table, and was walking toward her now. As he approached he could hear her voice, faintly.</p><p>&quot;Mmmhphhmmm! Ah yesh, cocks are the best!&quot; she murmured hoarsely, shifting slightly on the table. Her eyes flickered up to him, voice weak  but still cheerful. &quot;H-hey, back again? Ready to-&quot; Her eyes widened at the long erection hanging heavy between his legs. &quot;Oooh boy-&quot;&quot; He walked behind her, pulling her tail aside. Her sex was splattered with juices, both the customers and her own, running thick down her thighs. But her ass looked untouched.</p><p>&quot;Like what ya see? I'm all warmed up, just stick it in whenever-&quot; He pressed his pre-slick tip to her, higher than she had expected, leaning over her. Her eyes went wide again, mouth spreading in a teeth-gritted smile that was half fear and half eager, filthy anticipation. </p><p>&quot;Ooooh boy-&quot;</p><p>Pinkie parted easily around him as the unicorn pressed into her. It was obvious even this hole was well-used, but it was still tight enough to grasp him snugly, and even offer a little resistance. It took a few steady grinding motions before he finally managed to sink all the way in, feeling her soft flank against him, the heat of her dripping sex against his balls.</p><p>&quot;Oooooh yeah!&quot; the pink mare groaned out appreciatively as he sank into her again, every inch of his heavy length spreading her, filling her. Her front hooves grasped at the table, ass weakly pressing back against him. &quot;That's it, fuckin' gimme that cock!&quot;</p><p>Silver obliged, first slowly then quickly building to a hard fuck, thrusting eagerly against the well-fucked store cumdump,. His hooves grasped her flanks tight, holding her in place as he hammered her against the table. He could see the spell in his mind again, and he grunted in irritation,  leaning forward over her, bracing himself so he could thrust harder. The pent-up frustration of weeks of research flooded over him, and the more it did the harder he fucked, taking it all out on the pink mare beneath him. </p><p>&quot;Yeeah, right THEEEre, right there rIIIght there!&quot; Pinkie moaned under him, voice wavering as the thrusts hit, but the unicorn was in his own world now. Stupid spell, even here it wouldn't leave him alone. Why did it keep failing, why wouldn't it work?  Combination after combination, everything checked again and again, it was perfect. </p><p>The table started to shake, as did Pinkie as Silver pounded her, anger and lust violently rising together.  Why wouldn't it work, why? WHY?</p><p>WHY-</p><p>WOULDN'T-</p><p>IT-</p><p>COME!</p><p>The unicorn's head thrust back back as he felt himself suddenly tumble over the edge. With an angry snarl he let it all go inside the warm, soft fuckhole beneath him, and as the frustration and lust drained away his scowl gradually relaxed into a smile. Letting everything go felt so good. It felt so good to finally have some release Finally sweet Celestia some release.</p><p>He blinked. That was it. </p><p>There was no release couplet on the third index of the spell! That was why it kept failing! That was it!</p><p>Pinkie gave a happy, exhausted sigh as the unicorn pulled out of her. &quot;Mmmhm, tha waz reehly good. Yunno we cater? Yhou ever needa party I'm fuckin' there. Just-&quot;  But before she could finish, Silver was out of her, rushing around the table.</p><p>&quot;Hey are you listening? Mr. customer? Sir?&quot; But the unicorn was already out the door, the bell jangling softly behind him. Clearly in a hurry to get somewhere. &quot;Aww.&quot; She went limp against the table in disappointment. A frown lingered on her face a second before melting to a contented smile as she shuddered in satisfaction. &quot;Man, I hope that one comes back.&quot;</p><hr/><p>The cheers of the crowd echoed in the wide, dingy alley.  Ponies were packed in tight around two pegasi, one a bright, leafy green, the other a pale cyan, both surrounded by stallions either eagerly fucking the two mares or waiting for an opening. </p><p>Rainbow Dash grunted, straining to keep her footing in the mud as the stallion behind her gave a hard thrust. Pulling back a little from the shaft in her mouth, she stole a glance at the pegasus being fucked beside her. She was taking three cocks to Rainbow's two, on her back in the mud, one between her legs and one in each hoof. As Dash watched, she gave a twist to both of the cocks in her hooves, and the two stallions groaned in satisfaction, ropes of spunk splattering across the mare's face. </p><p>Rainbow mouthed a muffled obscenity against the cock in her mouth, watching angrily as a stallion on the sidelines leaned toward a scoreboard chalked against the alley wall: &quot;Rainbow Dash&quot; and &quot;Summer Gale,&quot; and adding two marks to the Summer column, bringing her lead to ten now. Summer caught Dashes eye, grinning smugly as two more stallions stepped in around her.</p><p>&quot;Hhucking Bhichh&quot; Rainbow muttered, bobbing faster along the hot flesh against her tongue. She could still hear the stupid mare's taunts in her mind. “You really think you're fast Dash? Then let's race. 'Cause I guarantee you'll be the one licking my hooves when it's over.”</p><p>Dash scowled. She had fought long and hard to be top pegasus, no one was going to take it from her. Especially this self-assured cunt. She was the fastest in Ponyville, and if Summer couldn't keep her mouth shut, she was going to learn it the hard way. Rainbow's eyes drifted past the crowd gathered around them to a large hourglass near the scoreboard, almost run down now. She grinned. Time to pick up the pace. </p><hr/><p>The sand left in the hourglass was barely visible now. Rainbow was moving frantically, but for all her effort her stallions weren't showing signs of going over the edge. Summer's lead had shrunk to four, but any second now the match would be over. If Rainbow didn't do something soon, her title was history. Summer looked over at the cyan pegasus, smiling smugly.</p><p>Rainbow smiled back. Summer blinked in confusion.</p><p>Rainbow gave a hard roll of her hips back into the stallion behind and below her. At the same time her hooves twisted just right along the cocks they were grasping. All four stallions gasped in unison,  shuddering as they came, giving Rainbow all they had.</p><p>And then her tail snaked around the cock in Summer's hoof, pulling it toward her with a firm tug. And pulling the stallion attached to it over the edge.</p><p>Summer's eyes went wide. As the last grain fell through the hourglass, five chalk marks went up on the board.</p><p>&quot;Rainbow Dash Wins!&quot;</p><p>The stallions around Summer pulled back, dropping her unceremoniously into the mud with a wet thud. Grumbling, they stepped closer,  leaning over the defeated pegasus, stroking themselves to a quick finish. Summer lay where she fell, eyes and mouth frozen in wide disbelief as the stallion's cum splattered across her flank, down her hair and cheek. </p><p>Dash rose from her position, giving her stallions a wink and walking confidently to her opponent, resting a hoof firmly on her head. Summer looked up at her, fear and confusion flashing in her eyes. “n-No, how could, you were, you were-” Rainbow pressed her hoof down, grinding Summer's head into the mud. “You lose bitch.”</p><p>“N-no, you cheated, you-” Dash twisted her hoof, forcing the fallen pegasus's mouth into the mud. “Don't be a sore loser Summer Slut.” She removed the hoof, taking a step back. “You know what you need to do.”</p><p>Shakily, Summer pulled herself from the mud and stumbled toward Dash, slow, limping, head down. She collapsed in front of Dash, shaking.</p><p>&quot;p-please-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Where does that mouth belong cunt?&quot;</p><p>Summer whimpered, pressing her nose and mouth against Dash's hoof and trying again. &quot;Plea-GUUH!&quot; Rainbow interrupted the request with a kick.</p><p>&quot;I'm not interested. There's only one thing you should be saying right now. Keep that second-rate cock polisher shut until you're ready to say it.&quot; </p><p>Summer gave another whimper, eyes pressing shut. After a brief pause, she spoke again, through gritted teeth.</p><p>&quot;i-I am sorry for challenging you. Fast leads and slow follows. I will follow and obey. Please enjoy me as you like.&quot;</p><p>Dash ground a hoof against Summer's head. &quot;There ya go. Was afraid your tiny brain might forget the words for a moment there.&quot; She gave Summer another light kick. “But that didn't sound very convincing to me. You really need to work on that attitude.” She grabbed a hoof full of Summer's hair, dragging her up off the ground and looking over the filthy pegasus with mock pity. &quot;Such a dirty mare. Let me help you with that.&quot;</p><p>With hard yank Dash dragged the struggling pegasus a few yards down the alley, stopping at a large, open rain barrel. &quot;Here ya go slut.&quot; She announced, unceremoniously dunking Summer into the icy cold water. She came up gasping and sputtering, and for a moment Dash pretended to give a concerned look. </p><p>&quot;Nope, still dirty.&quot; She declared and dunked again. The third time didn't go any better. By the fourth, Summer was swaying, eyes not able to focus on anything before she hit the water again. By the fifth the spunk and mud were long gone,  but Dash still wasn't satisfied. &quot;Man, you really take some work to clean up.”  Her eyes sparkled cruelly. “Maybe you need some scrubbing.&quot;</p><p>Summer had just enough time for a look of dread before she was under again. This time Rainbow held her there, hoof holding tight to her mane and shaking her hard under the water, knocking her head back and forth against the sides of the barrel. Summer struggled, desperate for breath, but Dash held her in place, shaking her head. &quot;No way cum rag, stay down. You're not done yet.”</p><p>Gradually, Summer's kicking and straining grew weaker, limper. Just before it stopped entirely, Dash pulled her plaything out of the water. Summer gasped in air-starved agony as she came up,  hacking and coughing, grasping at the barrel. &quot;That's better&quot; Rainbow said, looking her over. Summer relaxed slightly. &quot;Not good enough though.&quot; </p><p>She motioned to two stallions, who stepped out of the crowd. As they gripped Summer she tried to pull away, but she didn't have the strength anymore. They lifted her up over the barrel and dumped her in, head over tail. As soon as she was under, one put the lid back on, sitting down on top of it. Dash leaned up against the barrel, pressing her ear to the wood and grinning as she heard Summer's frantic thumps from inside. </p><p>&quot;Careful Summer, don't burn through your oxygen too fast. Gotta pace yourself.&quot;</p><p>She sighed happily, hoof stroking between her legs as the thumping inside the barrel slowly wavered, grew weaker, softer.  Until it faded into silence.</p><p>She closed her eyes, counted to ten. Then stood. Motioning the stallion to get off the top of the barrel, she leaned back, then swung forward, giving the barrel a hard kick along the top. It wobbled a moment, then toppled over, the water and Summer pouring out onto the muddy alley. </p><p>Summer lay still a moment, then gagged. Then she started to shake, weakly at first, then violently,  shivering, chest heaving from the cold water and desperate, desperate need for air. She hacked, coughing up water. Dash casually walked up to the almost-dead mare, watching her a moment. Then, without a word, she walked back to the alley wall, leaning casually against it. And gave a loud whistle.</p><p>Summer stirred in the mud, trying to to stand, falling, trying again. Finally she was on her feet, still coughing. Silently, she stumbled over to Dash, eyes on the ground. Dash smirked. “Ready to give this another try bitch? Is there something you'd like to say to my hoof?” Without response, Summer shakily lowered herself to the ground, tears running down her cheeks as she pressed her mouth to Dash's hoof. </p><p>&quot;I a-ah-am shorry for chhuallenging you. Fasht leads and shlow follows. Ah-a-I will follow and obey. Please eeehenjoy me ash you like.&quot;</p><p>The words were flat and earnest. There was no resistance left in the green mare's voice, only exhausted surrender.</p><p>Dash smiled. “Well said Summer. Looks like you can learn after all. Well then, I think I'll get started on that 'enjoying'.” Rainbow leaned back against the alley wall again, spreading her legs.  The seed of dozens of stallions dripped from her sex, ran down the warm flesh, splattered across her thighs. &quot;My teammates left quite a mess. Clean it up.&quot;</p><p>Tears welled in Summer's eyes. But she made no sound as she leaned forward, head limp in surrender as she pressed between Dash's thighs. Her tongue reached out, obediently licking at the slick flesh, slowly lapping away the thick white filth.</p><p>Rainbow sighed happily above her, stroking Summer's head. &quot;That's a good bitch. Right there.&quot; She gave Summer's hair a slight tug. &quot;Deeper loser, get your tongue in there!&quot; The broken pegasus obeyed meekly obeyed, pressing deeper into her new owner, mind and body following where they were led, limp and obedient. </p><p>When every drop of stallion spunk was licked clean, Summer worked her tongue and lips faster, rougher. Slowly Dash grew hotter against her mouth, slicker, gasping between her insults and commands, panting. Until finally she tipped over the edge, coming hard against Summer's tongue, grinding into her as the waves of orgasm rippled through her. </p><p>Dash smiled down at the green pegasus, stroking her head. &quot;Well, at least you're good at one thing.” She stepped forward, catching her breath. “Just one thing left then. I've got something for ya Summer.&quot; She motioned to one of the stallions, who handed her a heavy leather dog collar. At the clip, a metal pendant hung, cut in the shape of Dash's cutie mark. She leaned down, roughly circling it around Summer's neck, pulling it tight and buckling it in front to let the pendant hang  against her chest. &quot;Just so there's no confusion about what you are from now on.&quot; She whispered into her ear. Summer idly reached a hoof to the pendant, stroking it with a dazed expression. </p><p>&quot;Now then doggy-&quot; Dash leaned close, whispering something in Summer's ear. &quot;Got it?&quot; The broken pegasus nodded obediently. &quot;Good.&quot; Dash clipped a short leash to the collar, then walked Summer back to the crowd. &quot;Well everyone, my new bitch has finally learning her place, and she has something to say to you all.&quot; She gave the leash a tug.</p><p>Summer sank to a sitting pose, hooves raised like a begging dog,. Her voice was calm and even. &quot;Thank you all for coming to see the race. I'm sorry I was so slow and boring. I know some of you lost money on me. So please, let me make it up to you.” She sat, spreading her legs for the crowd.</p><p>One of the stallions looked to Dash with a hungry smile, raising an eyebrow. &quot;You sure?&quot; She grinned, tossing him the leash. &quot;Knock yourselves out.&quot; The crowd rushed Summer in an instant, pouring over her like a pack of starved dogs over a scrap of meat. For a brief moment her body bounced a little in the crowd, then disappeared, slipping beneath the mass of hungry, pent up stallions.</p><hr/><p>When Rainbow returned the crowd was gone. Summer lay sprawled limply in the middle of the alley. The stench of sex rising from her carried all the way to the street. Cum ran from every inch of the mare, pooling beneath her mouth and thighs. Her mane and tail were ragged, torn. Dash could see a few bruises here and there, though most looked accidental. Summer's eyes stared up at the sky, unfocused and blank. Dash rested a hoof on her chest. Waiting. After a long moment, she felt Summer breathe.  </p><p>She turned to the two pegasi following behind her, two mares wearing their own dog collar with her mark. She motioned to Summer, and they nodded respectfully. Each grabbed one of the limp mare's back legs, then turned to follow Dash, slowly dragging the defeated mare through the mud, out of the alley to her new life of service.</p><hr/><p>Fluttershy hummed happily as she stepped into the main room of her small cottage, an ornate wooden tray balanced on her back. She bent down next to a pair of mice, pulling out a tiny plate topped with a large slice of cheese from the tray and setting it in front of them. &quot;There you go. You're looking much better than yesterday. Ready to get back to the woods?&quot; The mice nodded. &quot;After you finish the cheese then.&quot;</p><p>She moved on to a squirrel with a bandaged arm, setting a bowl of nuts out for him. He reached for one, wincing a little against the sling. &quot;Oh, that still looks pretty bad.&quot; The squirrel gave her a sad look, but she smiled back. &quot;Don't worry, take as long as you need.&quot; He perked up at this, nibbling eagerly at the nut he had retrieved.</p><p>After the squirrel there was an owl, then a beaver followed by two bluejays. Finally Fluttershy reached the back of the room. Inside a large cage set against the wall lay a swan, beautiful but very, very ill. The feathers along its neck and wings were a ruffled, scattered mess. Here and there patches were missing. It lay limp, struggling to breathe against the hay that lined the cage, and when it heard her and looked up, its eyes were tired and red. </p><p>&quot;Oh my, you look even worse.&quot; She set down some food for it, reaching in to stroke its head. The swan attempted a smile, but ended up breaking into a cough, collapsing back to the cage floor. &quot;Poor thing. This isn't enough, you really are going to need some more serious treatment. Serious and expensive.&quot; Her eyes drifted a moment as she thought. When she looked back at the swan she saw him watching her. She smiled. &quot;Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. You get some rest.&quot; The swan nodded, promptly flopping back to the hay to sleep. </p><p>From a hook near the door, Fluttershy pulled down something that looked like a pair of saddlebags. Here though, the leather bags were two small wooden boxes, flat and wide, with hinged lids on the top that slanted down away from her as she fastened them in place, hanging comfortably from her back by wide leather straps. There was a small slit in each <br/>lid, and lettering on the front of the boxes: </p><p>DONATIONS:<br/>HELP A SICK ANIMAL TODAY!</p><p>With a finally stretch to make sure the straps were comfortable, Fluttershy stepped out the door, humming again.</p><hr/><p>The Ponyville farmer's market was a bustle of activity. Produce, breads, spices and more, all laid out in neat carts. Ponies slowly shuffled between the stalls, checking food in careful hooves while they chatted with the farmers.</p><p>&quot;Hey there Fluttershy!&quot; The yellow pegasus looked up to see a friendly earth pony stallion waving to her from behind a carrot stand. She smiled, trotting in his direction. &quot;Hello Bolero. Good carrots today?&quot; The earth pony smiled back warmly. He was shorter than Big Mac, but the hours spent in the field definitely showed themselves in his thick, sturdy build. &quot;Pretty good I'd say. Need ta' stock up fer that rabbit again?” Fluttershy shook her head. “No, Angel's still working through the last batch. These do look good though.” The stallion reached down, spreading a few for better viewing. “Hey, never hurts ta' have a few extra-” His eyes flickered up, noticing the 'saddlebags' on Fluttershy's back. &quot;Collecting for yer animals again?&quot;</p><p>Fluttershy nodded. &quot;Yes, I found a swan a few days ago that needs some serious help. I've been doing what I can, but if he needs more to really beat it.&quot; The carrot farmer smiled eagerly. &quot;Well, I suppose it's about time I pitched in on one of these.” Fluttershy blinked. “A-are you sure?” “Sure, sure, just come around back.&quot; Fluttershy blushed, nodding and following the stallion's gesture, slipping behind the stand to sit next to him, out of sight now save for her tail.</p><p>&quot;So, how much?&quot; Fluttershy blinked again. &quot;O-oh, oh yes. Um, ten for hoof, twenty-five for uh...for mouth.&quot; She looked down at the ground. A look of mild disappointment passed over Bolero's face. &quot;Ahw, really? Was hopin' the mouth wasn't so steep. “ As he spoke he stepped forward, closer. ”Well, ahhm sure yer good enough with the hoof.”  He shifted his back leg, and suddenly his sheath and balls were in her face, hanging inches from her nose. “Soon as yer ready then.&quot;</p><p>Fluttershy clumsily stumbled back as the scent of raw stallion hit her. Bolero didn't seem to notice; his eyes were already back on the crowd of potential customers. Steadying herself, Fluttershy reached out, gingerly raising a hoof to his balls. As she felt the warm, leathery flesh in her grasp she relaxed a little, starting to softly stroke, gently pressing and rolling. </p><p>Bolero gave an appreciative sigh, smiling as his eyes stayed on the crowd. Fluttershy kept at his balls a moment, then started to stroke his sheath. Long, firm strokes worked over him, base to edge like a dirty massage. Before long, she could feel him harden under her touch, and soon he was poking from the sheath, his wide, flat tip reaching further and further into the warm afternoon air under the careful, tender attention of her hooves. As the warm flesh filled out in front of her, hanging heavy so close to her mouth, Fluttershy licked her lips. If only Bolero had had another 15 bits.</p><p>But she fought back the urge, starting to stroke the eager length, one hoof tenderly running along the underside of the stallion's cock while the other teased at the base of his flare. If he wanted hoof, he was going to get it in spades.  &quot;Ahh yeah...&quot; Bolero murmured blissfully above her, eyes pressed shut in pleasure. </p><p>&quot;Hey there Bolero, what's up?&quot; Fluttershy froze as another voice greeted the farmer from across the stall suddenly. &quot;Nothin' much, just pro-vidin' these high-quality carrots for folks like yerself.” He gave Fluttershy a nudge with his back hoof.  Keep going. With a blush, she started stroking again.  ”What're ya interested in today?&quot; </p><p>Bolero and his new customer talked for a bit; about carrots, about the weather, about the coming fair next month. All while Fluttershy's hooves continued their work. And then-</p><p>&quot;Say Bolero, you seem a little distracted.&quot; The carrot farmer laughed. &quot;You could say that.&quot; &quot;Mmm?&quot; The customer sounded confused. Bolero smiled, suddenly pointing a hoof down behind the stand. &quot;See fer yerself.&quot;</p><p>The customer, who turned out to be a friendly-looking white pegasus braced himself on top of the stand, looking over it to see Fluttershy looking up at him, cock in hoof. &quot;Oh hey Fluttershy.” He said with a friendly smile. “hey” she choked. “Collecting again?&quot; She nodded. He slipped around behind the stall, bringing a half-erect cock to eye level at her side. &quot;What are you charging?&quot;</p><hr/><p>The sky was amber and orange above the farmer's market. Most of the stalls were packing up for the evening, save one carrot farmer. His stock was nearly gone, but a small crowd was gathered around his stall. In the center of the crowd sat a yellow pegasus, her face and hair dripping with the thick, white appreciation of her donors. Fluttershy's shyness had melted beneath the sticky warmth, and her head bobbed along the cock of a tidy unicorn now with eager abandon, both hooves stroking a different shaft on either side.</p><p>With a moaning shudder the unicorn in her mouth finished, and Fluttershy smiled around him, swallowing every drop he had to give. He looked happily dazed as he pulled out, more than content to drop the twenty five bits into the donation boxes resting against the stall.</p><p>Before another could take his place, someone in the crowd reached forward, rubbing and rolling a fresh carrot against her face, back and forth until it was slick, dripping. He held it in front of her.<br/>&quot;Got a treat for ya bunny. Come get it. I'll give ya ten bits to eat the tasty treat.&quot; </p><p>Fluttershy stared at it a moment, still pulling her mind away from the cock she had just finished. Then, with a happy, cum-drunk laugh she nodded, leaning forward to slowly, teasingly nibble her way down the orange length. As she reached the end she tugged it from the stallion's grasp with a playful lick, every filthy inch disappearing down her throat. 10 more bits clinked into the box. </p><p>Licking her lips, she looked up to the crowd, grinning. </p><p>&quot;Come on, dun be shy. Bunny wants sommore treats!&quot;</p><hr/><p>The stars were out as Fluttershy finally stumbled away from the farmer's market, boxes so heavy with bits she could barely carry them. The dazed high of the donation drive was starting to wear off, but there was still a wonderful warm glow humming through her, and she beamed as she slowly walked back home.  Bolero had even been kind enough to clean her off before she <br/>left. What a wonderful afternoon.</p><p>As she rounded a corner, a unicorn stepped out from behind one of the buildings, blocking her way. In the moonlight, she could see a scar running down his right eye. &quot;C-can I help you sir?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's a lot of bits you've got there girl.&quot; She spun around, only to find another blocking the way back. &quot;Yeah, a lot of bits.&quot; She shuffled nervously between them, looking back to the first. &quot;Can hear them clickety click a mile away, those bits.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I-i'm sorry, I'm not taking any more donations for today-&quot; she stuttered, trying to find a way out. The one in front of her, a unicorn, held out a switchblade, flicking it open just a few inches from her face. &quot;Oh but we are pretty pegasus. We are. Take em off. NOW!&quot;</p><p>Shivering, she complied, letting the boxes slide to the ground. The unicorn grinned in the darkness. &quot;Good. Now be a good filly and let us take the rest of what you've got.&quot; His partner stepped up closer behind her, giving her flank a good smack.</p><p>&quot;I-i, I don't, I mean, please, just, I&quot; The unicorn stepped closer, eyes level with hers, pressing the knife against her throat. &quot;Shut up and do as you're told. Tail up, legs spread. Or I swear I'll-OOF!&quot; The unicorn was cut off as a hoof connected hard with his head, sending him into the side of the building, knife spinning away into the darkness. </p><p>His partner took a step back, eyes searching the empty alley. &quot;What the- who's there? Don't get any bright-GAAH!&quot; He gave a strange little jump as a hoof caught under his chest, lifting him off his feet for a moment. &quot;Wha-?&quot; He had just enough time to recover before another found his head from above and he crumpled to the floor.</p><p>Still shaking, Fluttershy spun back and forth, eyes scanning the alley.</p><p>&quot;Miss?&quot;</p><p>She spun back, eyes widening as she saw-</p><p>“Bolero?”</p><p>The earth pony gave a sheepish laugh, reaching out a hoof. “Ya alright miss?” She nodded, taking it. &quot;Y-yes. Thank you.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Don't mention it.&quot; He circled behind her, grabbing the heavy donation boxes and shifting them back onto her. &quot;Hate to see these go to waste after all yer hard work today. You uh, might want to take a different route back next time.&quot; She nodded, watching him closely as he talked. &quot;Oh, here-&quot; He tossed a two coins into her box, a five piece and a ten. &quot;Fer all the business you brought in today.” </p><p>She stepped closer, smiling. He blinked, then shook his head. &quot;Oh, don't worry about that, no service needed. Just thought-&quot; She stepped closer, backing him against the wall. &quot;I, uh-&quot; Brought her face to his, smiling. &quot;I insist.&quot; She whispered, pressing into a deep kiss. </p><p>The stallion's eyes went wide, then slowly drifted close, smiling as he returned the kiss. He spun her round, pressing her against the wall now, kissing deeper. She smiled and spun them again, only to discover they had run out of wall. The two they toppled over into the warm darkness of the alley, laughing happily.</p><hr/><p>The moon shone bright over Fluttershy's cottage. Two dark figures approached the door. One reached out, slipping a key into the lock, and both stepped inside. Moonlight streamed from the window, sparkling over Bolero's face as he passed. His hoof caught something in the dark and he swore, barely stopping himself from sprawling across the cottage floor. Looking back, he plucked a stuffed mouse from its place under his hoof, scowling as he placed it back where it had fallen from, next to another. </p><p>A laugh came from the darkness behind him. “Need a light spell Bolero?” The earth pony scowled, continuing forward. “Yeh yeh, laugh it up Cy.” The figure behind him followed, still laughing as he stepped into the moonlight: a unicorn with a nasty scar down his right eye.</p><p>Their shadows slipped silently over the other inhabitants of the cottage as they walked further in: a squirrel toy with a bandaged arm, an owl, some bluejays, all carefully propped in place here and there on their perches. The unicorn paused in front of a large cage where a swan toy lay stiffly on one side, its black button eyes staring dumbly back at him. He gave a nod and a smirk, patting the swan. &quot;Get well soon pal.&quot; An angry whisper hissed from the next room. “Git over here Cy, I need the bags.” The unicorn rolled his eyes. “I'm coming.”</p><p>Bolero was standing over Fluttershy, fast asleep in her bed. To her side, the donation boxes rested on a flowery nightstand. With a practiced motion, Cy slipped two large saddlebags from his back, holding them out as Bolero poured the contents of the donation boxes into them. But no bits sparkled in the moonlight. Only crudely carved wooden circles clattered from box to bag, each with “1 Bit” hastily painted on the side.  </p><p>“That's the last of it.” The unicorn set the bags down, fastening them closed, then raising a hoof to a bruise along the side of his head. “You know you don't have to actually hit me right? It's an act.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Bolero replied in the most unapologetic tone possible.  Cy shuffled the bags, adjusting the weight. “Anyway, I want to be the hero next time.” </p><p>Bolero gave a snorting laugh, eying his scar. “With that thing? Yeh right.” </p><p>Cy gave a huff. “I'm a tragic hero!” </p><p>“Yer a tragic moron.”</p><p>Ignoring the earth pony, Cy circled to the foot of the bed, looking down at Fluttershy. Leaning forward, he reached a hoof out, pulling her back hoof to one side until the sleeping mare was spread, on full display for the two stallions. </p><p>“What're you doin' now?” Cy ignored the earth pony, crawling onto the bed. “Since I'm the only stallion in Ponyville who didn't get to fuck yellow slut today, I'm going to have a little midnight snack before we head back.”</p><p>Bolero snorted dismissively, heading for the door. “Fine. Yer carrying the bags back. Don't forgit 'em again.” Cy waved him away with a hoof. “Yeah yeah-” And turned back to the pegasus under him, still fast asleep as he slipped a hoof between her legs, gently stroking. </p><p>“Don't worry Fluttershy. I'll take care of everything.”</p><hr/><p>Golden Clover moaned, shuffling a little before he started gently thrusting again. The white unicorn under him gave a breathy sigh, pressing her soft rear back, into his thrusts as her front hooves braced against the mannequin in front of them. Slowly he grew more eager, still gentle but faster, and she urged him on, her curling tail teasing at his balls. At last he finished with a long, satisfied groan, and quickly pulled out, stepping back from her. </p><p>Rarity looked back at the stallion teasingly, swishing her tail. “Leaving so soon darling?” He gave a laugh. “Sorry, got places to be. Enjoyed it though.” he tossed her a small bag of bits. “There's the usual.” She smiled, retrieving the bag with her magic. “Thank you darling. It's always a pleasure to find such passionate customers.”  “Back atcha-” The stallion was at the door of the boutique now, reaching for the handle. But the door opened on its own. </p><p>Three ponies stared at Golden. On either side of the door, two mountainous earth ponies stood, taller that the door frame itself. Between then was a fiery, copper red mare with a short cut mane and what looked like a shorter temper. </p><p>“Leave.” She instructed. Golden quickly complied, hurrying through the gap the two stallions opened for him. The coppery mare turned her eyes to the unicorn. </p><p>Rarity bolted for the back of the shop, frantically trying to pry open the door, but it was stuck somehow, jammed. She felt a hoof on her shoulder and turned just as the stallions grabbed her,  dragging her back to the fiery mare as she struggled uselessly in their grip.</p><p>“Going somewhere Rarity?”</p><p>The unicorn glared. “Sorry Scarlet, I was having a hard time handling your smell.”</p><p>The mare smiled, then gave Rarity a hard punch to the face, jerking her back in the stallion's grip.  “I've been more than fair.” She stated calmly. “I made myself very clear. The Candied Apple will not tolerate competition and free-lancers. You were warned. You were offered a very nice position in our business. But you insist on operating independently. I am out of patience. If you won't be an employee, then I'll make you an example instead.” </p><p>She nodded to the stallions, who unceremoniously dumped Rarity to the ground.  The scarlet mare reached into her saddle bag, tossing something toward rarity that bounced and tumbled along the floor, coming to rest in front of her face. A collar and bit. </p><p>“Put them on. We're going for a walk.” Rarity glared up at Scarlet. &quot;And if I don't want to?&quot; </p><p>The two pony-shaped mountains to either side of her stepped forward, and the floor creaked wearily under their weight. Scarlet smiled &quot;You do.&quot;</p><hr/><p>The crowd parted for Scarlet as she entered the town square. A low murmur started as they saw who was following behind her on a leash. Collared and blindfolded, Rarity stumbled into the square, trying not to lose her footing on the uneven stones. She gave a yelp as a riding crop came down on her flank from one of the two massive stallions behind her, muffled by the drool-soaked bit stuffed into her mouth.</p><p>The stallion gave two more good strikes, and Scarlet glanced over her shoulder, enjoying the reaction as she kept leading her captive forward. </p><p>Soon the four ponies reached the center of the crowd. A small raised platform waited for them, and they stepped onto it, Rarity nearly falling flat on her face as she did. At the front of the platform was a simple wooden frame, one high horizontal beam supported on either end by two more, both firmly braced near the base. The stallions behind Rarity gave her a few more good hits, moving her into position, her side turned to the crowd so they could see the words painted across her in thick black letters:</p><p>DUMB CUNT</p><p>&quot;Thank you for coming everypony!&quot; Scarlet began, waving her hooves in a grand gesture. &quot;I am Scarlet Satin, owner and proprietor of the Candied Apple. Today, I have a little show for you, free of charge. It's not as fancy as our usual fare, but I hope you enjoy it.” She pointed a hoof at Rarity. “This mare and I have a business disagreement. I've offered very reasonable terms, but she refuses to cooperate. So now, I'm going to negotiate-” She gave the blindfolded unicorn a kick, sending her sprawling across the stage. “Aggressively. Would you like to watch?” The crowd cheered. </p><p>Scarlet gave the two stallions a nod. They stepped forward, taking some rope from the stage, and tying one end tight to each of Rarity's back hooves, then to the base of the frame on either side, pulling both tight enough to spread her legs wide.</p><p>With a quick motion, Rarity felt a third rope cinch tight around her wrists, binding them together, then pulling them up, and her with them until she was pulled vertical between the three ropes, belly to the crowd. Scarlet circled her, checking the knots. &quot;My, don't you look nice.&quot; She gave Rarity a firm smack against her flank, then turned back to the crowd. </p><p>&quot;Well then, let's get started!&quot; She grabbed Rarity's carefully styled mane suddenly, tugging it. &quot;Look how long she's let this get. I think she needs a trim, don't you?&quot; Rarity gave a loud MMMPh! of protest at this, struggling in the ropes. &quot;What's that cunt? You agree? Glad to hear it!&quot; Scarlet snatched a pair of scissors from one of the stallions, giving it a quick test in her hooves near Rarity's ear. &quot;Snip snip slut.&quot;</p><p>Rarity twisted in the ropes, but Scarlet held her head firmly in place, and the rest of her had nowhere to go. The rusty mare worked fast, slicing hair from the unicorn in thick clumps. Before long the perfect curls were were gone, reduced to a few straggly, pathetic patches. Scarlet grabbed her head, twisting it for the crowd. “How does she look?” An eager cheer. Scarlet grinned. </p><p>&quot;But I shouldn't be lazy. We can't trim the mane and not the tail, can we?&quot; Rarity gave a sad moan, but in a few snips her tail was on the stage floor too, cut down to a ragged stump. Scarlet stepped back, taking a look at the freshly shorn mare. &quot;There, much better. Don't you think?&quot; She asked the crowd, who gave an approving cheer.</p><p>&quot;Now, let's give these negotiations a little more bite.&quot; Rarity flinched as she felt something hard and leathery snake down her back, then gave a fearful, muffled sob into the gag as she realized what it was. Scarlet smirked, letting the long bullwhip slither slowly down the shivering unicorn. &quot;You like my friend, cunt? He has a message for you. Would you like to hear it?&quot;</p><p>Rarity shook her head, but Scarlet was already stepping back, readying the whip. &quot;Listen close!&quot; Rarity felt it before she heard it. The leather bit into her skin, deep and sharp. And then a loud, horrible CRACK filled the air.. She jolted in the ropes, gasping sharply against the bit, but managed to stop short of screaming. Scarlet raised an eyebrow. &quot;Not bad cunt. Let's see how long you can keep that up. ONE-&quot;</p><p>-CRACK-</p><p>&quot;TWO!&quot;</p><p>-CRACK-</p><p>&quot;THREE!&quot;</p><p>The crowd had gone silent, everyone watching as the blows came down.</p><p>-CRACK, CRACK, CRACK-</p><p>&quot;FOUR, FIVE, SIX!&quot;</p><p>-CRACK-</p><p>Rarity gave a gasping sob, straining against the ropes. Scarlet smirked, swinging again.</p><p>-CRACK-</p><p>An anguished moan, muffled.</p><p>-CRACK-</p><p>Louder.</p><p>-CRACK, CRACK-</p><p>The unicorn screamed into the bit, tugging helplessly out of instinct. “That's it you slut, scream for us!” Scarlet yelled, eyes glinting manically. She swung harder, faster, blows racing up and down the unicorn's back and flank. Rarity's screams started long and agonized, dripping with the sharp pain racing through her. As the blows kept coming,  her squeals slowly grew weaker, softer, her body both adjusting to the pain and losing strength. </p><p>Before long a sad pattern of thin red cuts laced over the mare's clean white coat. Scarlet stopped for a moment, stepping close. Rarity gave a sobbing gasp as she ran a hoof down her battered back. &quot;Tender? Let's care for these wounds, mmm cunt? Wouldn't want an infection.&quot;</p><p>Rarity's mind raced, trying to guess what her tormentor was talking about. Then she heard Scarlet step to the side, followed by the sloshing of a bucket. How was that going to- Oh.</p><p>Oh Celestia no. </p><p>She felt the water hit her back and knew in one horrible instant she was right.</p><p>Salt.</p><p>Rarity squealed like a butchered animal, flailing rabidly against the ropes. Her whole body heaved in a cascade of twisting spasms, trying uselessly to escape as the salt dug its claws into every cut laced across her back. Scream after scream tearing out of her throat in raw pain reflex, over and over and over until they slowly sank to moans, then sobs, long, exhausted, shaky sobs. </p><p>She heard Scarlet step up to her. &quot;Ready for round two slut?&quot; Rarity shook her head with a weak, despairing cry. &quot;Good!” She drew back the whip and brought it down.</p><hr/><p>Even the crowd had lost track of how many times Scarlet had used the bucket by now. Rarity hung limply on the ropes, barely responsive as the whip bit into her. Now and then her body would shake, chest shuddering in ragged gasps, but it was reflex, independent of any external pain. Her head hung limp, long streams of tears tracing down her face from under the blindfold. </p><p>Finally,  Scarlet stopped.</p><p>Tossing the whip aside, she stepped close to Rarity, reaching a hoof out to pulling off the blindfold.  The eyes underneath stared off into space, vague and unfocused, eyelids drooping. &quot;That was refreshing! Ready to apologize now cunt?” Rarity gave no response. Scarlet slapped her across the face. &quot;Wake up spunk hole!&quot; Slowly, Rarity lifted her head, looking up at Scarlet. &quot;That's better. You ready to be good?&quot; The unicorn nodded stupidly. &quot;Good!&quot;</p><p>Clicking open a box cutter, Scarlet hacked at the rope holding Rarity up, quickly slicing it apart. The white unicorn collapsed face-first to the stage. Scarlet stepped forward, grabbing her by what was left of her mane and pulling her up to face the crowd as she whispered in her ear. After a brief pause, Rarity spoke, slurring the words around low sobs.</p><p>&quot;I-iiima s-sory for bbehing a s-ss-stupid c-cunt. I-ih shu-surrendder mhyself ahhnd everthin I ooohwn to the C-candied Ahpple.&quot; Scarlet grinned nodding approvingly, then turned to the crowd. “What do you think?” A loud cheer. “Good!” She turned back to Rarity, letting her fall back to the stage. &quot;Well, I'm satisfied. But you're not quite done here yet.”</p><p>Rarity gave a sloppy look of confusion. “What about your customers cunt? All this time you've been selling them shoddy goods. I think you owe them a refund.” She dragged the confused unicorn around to face the back of  the stage, where the two massive stallions had just set down a large metal cage that filled most of the floor space. There was a single door on the front, which Scarlet swung open. With a quick movement she cut Rarity's remaining ropes, then nodded to one of the guards, who grabbed the unicorn and tossed her inside. Rarity dragged herself up to stare at Scarlet. </p><p>&quot;I even brought them here so you could work something out!&quot; Several guards led a group of ten or twelve stallions up to the edge of the stage. Rarity blinked, recognizing the faces of several frequent clients. The guards were holding them back with long poles hooked to heavy collars, and the stallions struggled against the control, jerking and twitching frantically. </p><p>Scarlet walked up to one near the front, and Rarity recognized Golden Clover. But his eyes were fiery now, mouth twisted in an angry snarl. &quot;We wanted to make sure you all had fun together&quot; Scarlet explained. &quot;So we gave your clients here a bit of the drugs we use to help encourage shyer customers sometimes. Unfortunately we may have over-done the dose. A lot.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Oops.&quot; </p><p>Rarity started to shuffle fearfully toward the back edge of the cage. &quot;Don't worry though, I'm sure you'll all still have lots of fun. Isn't that right Golden?&quot; She asked, leaning toward him. He gave a snarl, trying to lunge for her repeatedly despite the collar at his neck. &quot;That's the spirit!&quot; She turned to the guards, voice low. &quot;Put them in.&quot;</p><p>The guards let the poles drop, and Rarity's eyes went wide as the stallions rushed into the cage, screaming despite her exhaustion. </p><p>“Noooo! No please! No no no no! Help, help Heeeee-ggglk!”</p><p>And the white unicorn disappeared, going silent beneath the sea of crazed stallions.</p><hr/><p>Carousel boutique was gutted. </p><p>Every window had been smashed in. The door lay several feet from the frame. The interior had been ransacked, everything valuable taken, everything not destroyed and scattered across the floor. </p><p>In front of the door, a white unicorn hung, suspended from the overhanging roof  by rope tied tight around her wrists. She was motionless except for the gentle swaying of the wind, head hanging against her chest. Her body, pulled tight by gravity, was covered in cuts, bruises, bites. Yellowing spunk was splattered everywhere across her. A small sign hung from her neck.</p><p>“OUT OF BUSINESS.”</p><p>Suddenly the unicorn stirred, giving a slight shudder. A soft, almost silent whimper. A stream of thick cum ran down her thigh and hoof, dripping to the ground below. And then she was still again.</p><hr/><p>Celestia stepped off the train, taking a quick look to either side of the platform, then continuing forward. Everything seemed fine. Twilight's letters had been coming as always. All the officials that came and went from Ponyville had nothing unusual to report. Nor did the ponies she had sent discretely to check over the town. And as she stepped off the platform, walking into the town, she could see nothing that contradicted them. </p><p>But no matter what she tried, the princess couldn't shake the shadow from the corners of her mind, something wrong lurking just out of reach. So she was here again. How many times now?Too many, probably. She mentally checked the simple disguise spell hanging over her. Still in place. No reason to distract anypony.</p><p>Crossing the town square, she could Rarity talking with some fancy looking stallions over drinks. Further on, Pinkie was trying to lure customers into Sugar Cube corner with a fresh batch of cupcakes. Through a gap in the buildings, she could catch a glimpse of Sweet Apple Acres, peacefully nestled into the countryside as always. A passing earth pony greeted her, and she smiled, returning the greeting. Everypony was friendly, bustling, ordinary. Everything was fine.<br/>So why couldn't she convince herself?</p><p>At last she reached Twilight's tree. Maybe her student could find some insight on all this. She raised a hoof to the door.</p><p>&quot;Hello Celestia.&quot;</p><p>The voice came from behind her. The princess turned to see Twilight staring at her. She smiled, impressed but not particularly surprised that her pupil could see past the disguise. &quot;Hello Twilight. I'm sorry to bother you, but I still feel something is very wrong here. May I come in for a moment?&quot;</p><p>Twilight shook her head. &quot;No.&quot; Celestia gave her a quizzical look. &quot;And why is that my student?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It isn't time.&quot; Celestia felt something tighten in her chest. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It isn't time.&quot; She repeated, stepping closer. Celestia suddenly realized there was a crowd around them, ponies from all over the town. How had she not seen them?</p><p>&quot;What do you-&quot; But before the princess could finished, Twilight opened her mouth and screamed. Not audibly, but magically. A shrill, piercing, horrible vibration that tore into Celestia's horn like claws. The crowd joined her, the scream building and building until it was a deafening screech, howling in the alicorn's mind. She stumbled back, trying to weave a spell, but the pain and confusion were too much, she couldn't focus. The world spun and swayed around her. She felt herself trip and fall, tumbling, tumbling, down, down, down...</p><p>Princess Celestia stepped off the train and onto the platform with a happy sigh. It was good to be back in Canterlot. Another false alarm. She laughed, grateful that her student was so patient with her paranoia. But it was good to be cautions, and good to see Twilight again. Still, she shook her head as she left the train station, laughing again. Maybe now she could finally relax. Now that it was so clear that everything was fine.</p><hr/><p>No one was coming to the door.</p><p>Scrap knocked again and waited, listening. But no sound came from the small Ponyville cottage. She leaned into the door, struggling to press it open. It wasn't locked, but one of the hinges had been bent, and the door dragged against the floor now, protesting with a low wooden grinding sound as she pried it open and stepped inside.</p><p>&quot;Silver?&quot;</p><p>Dust covered everything in the hallway, rising up in small swirling clouds as she walked forward, peering into the dining room. It was empty, table and counter bare. &quot;Silver?&quot; She walked on, checking the living room. Just as dead. Finally she reached the door at the end of the hall, one that swung open easily, welcoming her to the small study.</p><p>The room was a small rectangle, high shelves covering all of one wall and half of a second, arching over a thick wooden desk. Books were stuffed into the shelves in what had been a neat, careful system, but now half of them were pulled from their places, sprawled across the desk, stacked here and there on the floor or simply missing.</p><p>The fourth wall, one of the two narrow ends of the room, was covered in one large blackboard. The faint remains of several magical equations and theories were still visible along the edges, where the eraser hadn't been able to pull them from the slate. But most of the board was covered in one phrase now.</p><p>&quot;Everything is fine.&quot;</p><p>Over and over, different angles, sizes, even a few distinct languages, neat at first, then sloppier, the letters shaking, wavering, scrawling over each other until parts of the board were pure white. At the base of the wall, a small silver unicorn was hunched, his hoof held out to the board, pressed to the final letter of a small word at the base of the wall.</p><p>&quot;Help&quot;</p><p>&quot;Silver Lining?&quot;</p><p>As her eyes adjusted to the dull light of the room, Scrap could see the unicorn wasn't silver anymore. He was a dull gray, thin and gaunt, unmoving. As she knelt closer, she could see his face, twisted in exhausted fear. Unmoving. Eyes wide, but blank, empty like a statue. And as she saw his eyes, Scrap felt a rush of excitement run down her spine. </p><p>Excitement and pleasure.</p><hr/><p>Ponyville was quiet. The sound of Scrap's hooves against the gravel echoed off crumbling houses, her reflection shimmering in the jagged teeth of broken windows as she passed. Here and there ponies stood in the street, gray and still, on their way to a destination they would never reach. Vines were starting to grow up the legs of a few.</p><p>Scrap took a shortcut through a ruined cafe, picking her way around bits of collapsed roof and wall. Weeds poked through gaps in the black and white tiled floor, but the customers didn't seem to mind the mess. They sat in twos or threes at the tables, deep in conversation, some laughing, some with much more fearful expressions. All still, all quiet. </p><p>All gray.</p><p>At last Scrap reached the town hall, still mostly intact. She could feel the excitement growing now, in her chest and between her legs. She stepped forward, pressing open the door to stepped inside. A long red carpet traced a path down the wide interior. Ponies were crowded in on both sides, laying back on couches and cushions, spread over tables, kneeling in front of their partners. All twisted around each other like animals, mating hungrily, drooling, eyes half lidded, or wide <br/>in pleasure. Scrap remembered the sounds they had filled the hall with, the smell. But the hall was silent now. Silent, still, and gray.</p><p>At the end of the carpet, on a raised platform, sat a throne. On the throne sat her Master. His book rested on a small stand next to him. To either side, her friends lay, lounging on sleek pillows. The white unicorn and yellow pegasus were to his right, the tawny earth pony and the pink one to his left, the blue pegasus at his feet, softly licking. They lay on their sides, swollen bellies resting against the floor, heavy with foals. </p><p>A mare sat at her Master's feet, head nestled between his legs. As Scrap got closer, she recognized the mare's cutie mark. She was the former Mayor of the town. Master had been looking for her for a while. It looked like he'd finally dug her out of wherever she had been hiding. The gray mare coughed suddenly, stumbling back away from the throne, mouth and face dripping. She saw Scrap, reached out a hoof. But before she could say anything, she shuddered, stiffened. Her eyes, locked with Scrap, slowly faded, pupils sinking into pure white emptiness. The white sank into gray. And then she toppled over, hoof still outstretched.</p><p>Scrap felt the excitement run through her again, so strong now. </p><p>She stepped over the mare, bowing before her Master. She was shaking as she pressed her lips to his right hoof-”Service is Joy.” Then his left-”Service is Peace.” And rested her head in it's rightful place. “I will serve and be at peace.”<br/>“We will serve and be at peace.” She heard her friends murmur faintly. </p><p>She felt his hoof rest gently on her head and shuddered in pleasure. And then his voice-</p><p>&quot;You have finished your task.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes Master.&quot; She panted against the ground. She could feel her arousal dripping down her thighs. “There are no other ponies left to serve.” There was a horribly long pause. And then-</p><p>&quot;Would you like your reward?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please.&quot; She breathed, heart jumping. She felt his hoof gently tap her forehead and obediently brought her head up. His legs were spread, and between them his shaft hung, thick and heavy and so close she could smell it. Her eyes went wide as they fixed on it. Hungry with anticipation.</p><p>&quot;Good. You may serve.&quot;</p><p>She barely felt herself rush up onto his lap. One instant she was sitting, the next she was with him on the throne and his hot, hard flesh was pressed between her legs. She moaned, grasping him as all the repressed need came flooding back. She had served so many stallions now, but none of them were him. None of them were Master. They were all only part of her reason for being. He was her reason, all of it. And he felt so good.</p><p>She rolled her hips, barely able to handle the feeling of his length grinding against her, so wonderful, satisfying an ache that had been growing for so long now. She felt his hooves on her waist, felt him shift under her. And thrust forward.</p><p>And he was in her, her dripping, well-used sex offering no resistance at all. All it took was one good thrust and he sank </p><p>all-</p><p>the way-</p><p>in.</p><p>Scrap came. Every muscle, every thought was red-hot with satisfaction, delight, joy. Relief. She squealed, groaning gratitude as she went limp in his grasp, legs twitching against him in wonderful aftershock.</p><p>“Maaaster...”</p><p>He started to thrust. Scrap's eyes went wide, her mind trying to find some way to handle the rush of sensations, but failing almost instantly. She could barely handle just having him inside her, it had been so long. Moving was too much, too fast, she needed time. But she wasn't getting it. He was going to take her, and all the helpless mare could do was let it happen, let the pleasure burn through her, over and over and over.</p><p>Scrap did her best, but before long she was having trouble not blacking out. Every new orgasm made it a little harder to hang on, drew more out of her. She could feel magic holding her, digging into her, and realized that it was the only thing keeping her eyes open.  And then her Master came. </p><p>With a low groan and a final thrust, his seed rushed into her. As it did, she felt a surge of magic jump from the book beside them, rushing out through the hall. What she didn't see was what happened as it hit the still, gray ponies behind her, tearing away flesh, muscle, stripping everything. Until all that was left were bones, frozen in the same position as the ponies they had belonged to, fused together. </p><p>Scrap lay limp against Haze, drooling from a satisfied smile. Finally deep in dreamless oblivion. As Haze continued to enjoy her,  the soft sounds of their sex echoed in the hall as the silent bones watched, a thin cloud of ash slowly drifting to the floor. </p><hr/><p>Wagon Wheel gave an exhausted sigh as he stepped from the cabin of the locomotive. It had been a long trip from Canterlot, and he was glad he was on the Ponyville line: easy to get a good night's rest in a quiet town like this. He dragged himself to the ticket window, waving. </p><p>&quot;Hey Lucky! Surefire better be hiding in one of these trash bins because I'm not running this train another inch tonight.&quot; He slid his time card across the counter. &quot;Punch me out, I'm gonna go collapse.&quot; There was no response. &quot;Lucky?&quot; Wagon looked up, into the booth for the first time.</p><p>A bleached pony skull stared back at him. </p><p>&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Suddenly Wagon discovered an untapped well of energy, legs tap-dancing a hurried retreat as he tried to process what he had just seen. He really, really wanted to believe it was a joke, but unfortunately the view he had got had been too close for that. It wasn't plastic or painted wood. That had been real bone, in a real skeleton, really wearing Lucky's uniform, and now he was really getting the hell out of here and finding the nearest guard.</p><p>He rushed around a corner and hit an immovable object, bouncing back to sprawl on the floor. Picking himself up, he saw he had hit a stallion, earth pony in a muted, dusty brown. He seemed to have several pregnant mares behind him. </p><p>&quot;I would like to go to Canterlot.&quot; He said, ignoring the sudden collision. Wagon laughed. &quot;That's great, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait a bit, platform's closed for now, back that way-&quot; As he pointed toward the exit, Wagon felt something strange in his head, a burning, tingling sensation, the feeling of something reaching.</p><p>And then everything was still, and calm.</p><p>&quot;Yes Sir,&quot; Wagon replied, calm and monotone. &quot;I'll get the engine ready.&quot;</p>
